{"COLCAP": [], "CRSMBCT": [{"content": "Visa, MasterCard Merchant Fee Settlement Sent to Judge\nBy Christie Smythe - 2012-10-20T00:00:05Z\nVisa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) \u2019s settlement of a merchants\u2019 lawsuit over credit card fees, a deal that may cost the companies and banks as much as $7.25 billion, was submitted for approval to a federal judge.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 lawyers today formally asked U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New York , to sign off on the agreement covering about 7 million retailers. The settlement would resolve seven years of litigation over allegations that Foster City , California-based Visa and Purchase, New York-based MasterCard conspired with major banks to fix the fees merchants pay when customers use a credit card.\n\u201cToday\u2019s filing is an important milestone toward resolving the long-running litigation between the nation\u2019s retailers, financial institutions and payment networks,\u201d Josh Floum, Visa\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement. \u201cWhen finalized, this settlement will bring to an end nearly 10 years of repeated legal challenges against the default interchange system.\u201d\nA hearing on preliminary approval of the settlement is expected to be held in December or early next year, according to attorneys involved in the case. Final approval of the deal may take a year, said Robert Stolebarger , a lawyer for the Electronic Payments Coalition, a credit- and debit-card industry group that has advised the defendants.\n\u201cI fully expect that this will go on for a while,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cI think everyone was prepared for that.\u201d\nRetailer Opposition\nSeveral merchant trade organizations and large retailers oppose the settlement, arguing its terms, including releases from future claims regarding so-called interchange fees, are too generous.\nGroups and companies that have spoken out against the deal include the Retail Industry Leaders Association, the National Retail Federation , the National Restaurant Association, the National Community Pharmacists Association and the National Association of Convenience Stores, as well as retailers Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and Target Corp. (TGT)\n\u201cWe look forward to making our case to the courts that this one-sided deal should be rejected,\u201d the Retail Industry Leaders Association president, Sandy Kennedy, said in a statement. \u201cThe outrage within the retail community over this flawed proposal and the harm that it will cause cannot be understated.\u201d\nFormal Objection\nA lawyer for some of the other groups, Jeffrey Shinder, said he also plans to file a formal objection.\nSince the settlement was made public in July, 10 of 19 retailers who were plaintiffs in the suit have dropped out of the deal, according to K. Craig Wildfang, a lead lawyer for the plaintiffs.\nWildfang said no material changes were made to the deal since its release. The proposal includes cash payments of $6.05 billion, an eight-month reduction in interchange rates for merchants and rule changes that could potentially allow retailers to impose surcharges on customers\u2019 purchases, according to court documents.\nPlaintiffs who did sign on include Payless ShoeSource Inc., Photos Etc. Corp., Discount Optics Inc. and Leon\u2019s Transmission Service Inc., according to the court papers filed today.\n\u201cThe agreement is very much in the interests of the merchants and those who have objected are either misinformed or have other agendas, or both,\u201d Wildfang said in an interview. \u201cWe are way over the bar for preliminary approval and we hope and expect that Judge Gleeson will agree with us.\u201d\nPolitical Motives\nElectronic Payments Coalition representatives said the groups who oppose the deal may have political motives.\nU.S. Senator Richard Durbin \u2019s office has told retailers that they may lose out on future legislative opportunities to rein in credit-card fees if they support the settlement. Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois , secured the inclusion of limits on swipe fees for debit cards in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, trimming revenue for the largest U.S. banks by about $8 billion.\nVisa said today in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that its share of the settlement will be about $4 billion. Other defendants include about a dozen banks, including Citigroup Inc., (C) HSBC Bank Holdings Plc (HSBA) , PNC Bank (PNC) , Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) and Bank of America Corp. , according to the filing.\n\u201cAs with any settlement, both sides had to give a little or a lot here and there to reach a compromise, and as a result, no one is entirely happy,\u201d Stolebarger said in a statement. \u201cBut in the end, in my view, this settlement represents the very best and most realistic outcome possible for all involved.\u201d\nThe case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York ( Brooklyn ).\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Christie Smythe in New York at csmythe1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Hytha at mhytha@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:31:23", "post_time": "2012-10-19 20:00:05", "author": "Christie Smythe", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-19/visa-mastercard-merchant-fee-settlement-sent-to-judge.html", "title": "Visa, MasterCard Merchant Fee Settlement Sent to Judge", "post_date": "2012-10-19", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "CRSMBCT", "embers_id": "ec8c91d12677d0b3930aa4cffc0c4b23224c4614"}], "IBVC": [], "BVPSBVPS": [], "IGBVL": [], "MERVAL": [], "CHILE65": [{"content": "Suez Environnement Denies Veolia Merger Under Consideration\nBy Ben Bain - 2012-10-20T22:10:30Z\nSuez Environnement (SEV) , Europe\u2019s second- biggest water company, denied that it is working on a merger with its bigger rival Veolia Environnement SA.

The country\u2019s three other biggest lenders -- Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) , state-controlled Banco do Brasil SA and Banco Santander Brasil SA -- have also fallen to their lowest versus the benchmark in at least a year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nAnalysts have been trimming earnings estimates for Brazilian banks amid government pressure to cut consumer credit costs as the central bank lowers benchmark rates to record lows. President Dilma Rousseff said last month that doing so would reduce their profits to \u201ccivil levels.\u201d Banco do Brasil and state-run Caixa Economica Federal have led the way with lower rates and fees, prompting private banks to follow suit.\n\u201cThe times of very high returns are over,\u201d Gustavo Schroden, an analyst at BES Securities, said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. \u201cThe strategy to use state-controlled banks to force the others to reduce interest rates and service fees seems natural and will not change. This fiercer competition is part of the scenario for financial institutions from now on.\u201d\nItau declined 1.1 percent to 29.50 reais at the close of trading today in Sao Paulo. Bradesco slid 0.3 percent to 32.35 reais, while Banco do Brasil dropped 0.9 percent to 22.70 reais and Santander retreated 1.8 percent to 14.63 reais.\nItau Shares Fall\nItau has fallen 13 percent this year as the Sao Paulo-based bank cut its average monthly interest rate on consumer loans to 3.38 percent earlier in October from 4.2 percent in December, 2011. On Oct. 17, the bank also announced it would reduce some service fees by as much as 33 percent. Osasco, Brazil-based Bradesco reduced its monthly average rate from 5.15 percent to 3.83 percent. Banco do Brasil has dropped 4.2 percent, while the Bovespa index is up 3.8 percent.\n\u201cItau is focused on improving its efficiency by cutting costs and increasing revenues,\u201d the bank\u2019s press office said in an e-mailed response to questions. \u201cWith this new scenario of lower profitability, Itau is seeking to raise its income with services and non-banking financial products, like insurance.\u201d\nBradesco declined to comment. Banco do Brasil and Caixa didn\u2019t respond to e-mails and phone calls seeking comment.\nBrazilian consumers paid an average of 35.6 percent on loans annually in August, down from 46.2 percent a year earlier, according to data compiled by the central bank. That\u2019s the lowest since at least 1994, when the monetary authority began monitoring the figure. Consumer rates in the U.S. declined to 8.06 percent in August from 11.39 percent a year earlier, according to Bankrate.com.\n\u2018Too Early\u2019\nIt may be premature to reduce earnings forecasts because lending growth will likely offset falling profits caused by lower interest rates on loans, said Luis Miguel Santacreu, an analyst at Brazilian rating company Austin Rating.\n\u201cIt seems too early to make such a negative forecast for Brazilian banks,\u201d Santacreu said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo . \u201cThese financial institutions are very well capitalized and there is a lot of room for credit to expand, comparing the country\u2019s total financing portfolio with the world average. Banks could compensate for a decline in revenue in the short term with a growing loans portfolio.\u201d\nDomestic credit provided by Brazilian banks amounted to 98.3 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product in 2011, compared with a global average of 163.5 percent, according to the World Bank .\nOutstanding Loans\nBanco do Brasil\u2019s lending growth is outpacing Itau and Bradesco. The bank increased its outstanding loans to 508.2 billion reais in the second quarter, up 20 percent from a year earlier, according to a regulatory filing. That compares with a 15 percent gain for Itau and a 14 percent rise for Bradesco.\nLending in Brazil has surged 67 percent since 2009, data compiled by the central bank show. Expanding credit pushed the default rate to the highest in almost three years, sapping consumer demand and threatening to saddle banks with bigger losses as overburdened consumers take on more debt.\nBanco do Brasil and Caixa, both based in Brasilia, have been lowering interest rates and service fees since August 2011, when the central bank started cutting the Selic rate. Policy makers have since reduced the benchmark by 525 basis points, the most among Group of 20 nations, to a record 7.25 percent. Rousseff has compelled state-run lenders to cut borrowing costs as part of an effort to boost growth that includes tax cuts.\n\u2018Structural\u2019 Changes\nThe average return on equity for Brazil\u2019s biggest banks, which fell to 18.2 percent last year from a 2005 peak of about 30 percent, will decline to 16.2 percent this year and 16 percent in 2013, Philip Finch, a strategist at UBS AG in London , wrote in an Oct. 11 note to clients. The average return on equity is a measure of how efficiently companies generate income.\n\u201cWe view ongoing lending rate reductions instigated by state-controlled banks as structural in nature with an additional cyclical component, and do not expect lending rates to return to former levels once GDP growth recovers,\u201d Finch wrote. UBS lowered its earnings-per-share estimates by an average of 11 percent for 2012 and 16 percent for 2013 for the Brazilian banks it covers.\n\u2018Investment Opportunities\u2019\nCaixa, Banco do Brasil, Bradesco and Itau said last month that they\u2019re cutting credit card rates, with Banco do Brasil lowering some by as much as half. The state-controlled banks also reduced fees on banking services this month. The reductions make it \u201cincreasingly difficult for the banks to compensate for revenue losses on credit card rates,\u201d Rafael Ferraz and Francisco Kops, analysts at Banco J. Safra in Sao Paulo, wrote in a note to clients on Oct. 1.\nCredit cards account for about 10 percent of total loans for Itau, compared with 7.1 percent at Banco Santander Brasil SA (BSBR) , 6.6 percent at Bradesco and 3 percent at Banco do Brasil, according to a Sept. 25 report by Deutsche Bank AG.\n\u201cThe rate cuts are definitely not positive for the banks,\u201d said Schroden at BES Securities. \u201cAfter looking at earnings results in the following quarters, we\u2019ll see how the banks adjust their strategies and which stocks remain good investment opportunities.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Denyse Godoy in Sao Paulo at dgodoy2@bloomberg.net ; Francisco Marcelino in Sao Paulo at mdeoliveira@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Papadopoulos at papadopoulos@bloomberg.net\nItau Sinks as Rousseff Plan Hurts Bank Profits\nDado Galdieri/Bloomberg\nItau has fallen  12 percent this year as the Sao Paulo-based bank cut its average monthly interest rate on consumer loans to 3.38 percent earlier in October from 4.2 percent in December, 2011.\nItau has fallen  12 percent this year as the Sao Paulo-based bank cut its average monthly interest rate on consumer loans to 3.38 percent earlier in October from 4.2 percent in December, 2011.

The changes open the way for local affiliates of Experian Plc (EXPN) and Equifax Inc. (EFX) , the world\u2019s biggest credit bureaus, to compile payment histories that previous legislation barred them from accessing.\nBrazil\u2019s 323 percent average annual credit-card rates compare with 17 percent in the U.S. and 34 percent in Mexico , according to a study by consumer-defense association Proteste published in July. The legal changes correspond with Rousseff\u2019s effort to get banks to cut lending rates after policy makers lowered the benchmark to a record 7.25 percent last week to help revive growth forecast to be the slowest since 2009.\n\u201cThe big benefit is you can charge better customers less, and worse customers more,\u201d said Erico Ferreira, the Sao Paulo- based head of Acrefi, Brazil\u2019s association of credit, financing and investment institutions. \u201cYou can offer better pricing.\u201d\nThe law repeals rules that allow card issuers to only gather data on defaults and delinquencies.\nCredit Scoring\nCredit scoring will help bolster Brazil\u2019s credit card expansion in years to come after lending grew 17 percent in the 12 months through August, compared with 19 percent the year before, said Jose Renato Simao Borges, the former head of credit cards at Osasco, Brazil-based Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) who is now president of credit-card issuer Credz.\n\u201cIn every country where credit scoring was allowed, credit grew 50 percent afterwards,\u201d Borges said in an interview.\nRousseff\u2019s predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, vetoed similar legislation in 2010, citing concerns by consumer groups over privacy rights. Final approval by Rousseff was held up as the government and credit bureaus debated privacy and liability issues tied to collecting the data, according to Boa Vista Servicos, a credit data company 15 percent owned by Equifax.\nThe new rules allow bureaus to track debt-to-income ratios and payment punctuality and require that consumers provide consent before their histories can be recorded.\nExpanded Access\nWhile Rousseff said in a nationally televised address on Sept. 6 that she wasn\u2019t satisfied with banks\u2019 efforts to cut borrowing costs, banks say the rates they charge reflect the risk they take on. Default rates rose to 28 percent in August on credit-card accounts at least 90 days overdue, almost four times the 7.9 percent on consumer loans , according to data from the central bank.\nThe new rules will expand access to credit for Brazilians whose per capita income is 291 reais to 1,019 reais ($143 to $502) a month, the classification for the nation\u2019s emerging middle class, Dorival Dourado, the president of Boa Vista, said in an interview in his Sao Paulo office. Only 18 percent use credit cards as their main form of payment, compared with 44 percent of those who earn at least 2,480 reais, according to Boa Vista.\n\u201cThe bureaus will allow companies to know more about these people and create better conditions for lower rates,\u201d Dourado said.\nFinancial Data\nThe new rules will quadruple the amount of information regulators have about the financial system, reaching 96 percent of all individual loans, central bank President Alexandre Tombini said in March at an event in Sao Paulo to present the revamped system. They will also help the central bank design measures to ensure the financial system functions soundly, he said.\nAverage credit-card rates in Brazil could be as much as 35 percent lower should banks be able to get an accurate profile of whom they\u2019re lending to, Dourado said. The old system caused all customers who don\u2019t have a record of default to be treated as equally risky, he said.\nWhile credit can improve the quality of life for Brazilians emerging from poverty, many consumers aren\u2019t prepared for the responsibilities and risks of taking on debt, said Larissa Davidovich , who heads the unit for protection of highly indebted consumers at the public defender\u2019s office in Rio de Janeiro.\nA 67 percent surge in lending in Brazil in the last three years as more people became eligible for credit helped push the default rate on credit cards to a three-year high in August, sapping consumer demand and threatening to saddle banks with losses.\nCredit Education\n\u201cThe problem is the accumulation of debt by people who don\u2019t have the education or preparation and aren\u2019t aware of what they\u2019re getting into,\u201d Davidovich said at an event in Sao Paulo held by the association of credit-card businesses. \u201cWe are receiving more and more requests from people in drastic situations, like a woman who amassed 14 credit cards.\u201d\nThe extra yield investors demand to own Brazilian government dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 134 basis points at 10:11 a.m. in Sao Paulo, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)\nThe cost of protecting Brazilian bonds against default for five years rose one basis point to 110 basis points, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent if a borrower fails to adhere to its debt agreements.\nDefault Rates\nThe real strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.0292 per dollar. Yields on interest-rate futures contracts due in January 2014 fell two basis points to 7.41 percent.\nPersonal loan default rates have peaked and will drop amid slowing credit growth as banks stop extending loans to the riskiest borrowers, said Ricardo Loureira, the president of Serasa Experian, Brazil\u2019s largest credit data provider, which is controlled by Dublin-based Experian said in a telephone interview.\nPositive credit histories will lead to more credit for those with a record of paying on time and will increase the volume of transactions, he said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo.\n\u201cThe previous model has been exhausted for the dimensions of credit in Brazil,\u201d Loureira said. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer possible to continue managing risk with the previous model.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Blake Schmidt in Sao Paulo at bschmidt16@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Papadopoulos at papadopoulos@bloomberg.net ; Michael Tsang at mtsang1@bloomberg.net\nPresident Dilma Rousseff\nEvaristo Sa/AFP/Getty Images\nThe legal changes correspond with President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s effort to get banks to cut lending rates after policy makers lowered the nation\u2019s benchmark to a record 7.25 percent last week to help revive growth forecast  to be the slowest since 2009.\nThe legal changes correspond with President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s effort to get banks to cut lending rates after policy makers lowered the nation\u2019s benchmark to a record 7.25 percent last week to help revive growth forecast  to be the slowest since 2009.

Brazil\u2019s Bovespa stock index climbed for the first time in five days as Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) and Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) , Brazil\u2019s biggest banks, advanced.

The average is the lowest since the bank began monitoring the number in 1994. Rates on corporate loans fell to 23.1 percent from 23.6 percent, while the average rate on loans fell to 30.1 percent from 30.7 percent in July.\nGovernment officials led by President Dilma Rousseff have expanded measures aimed at spurring credit growth while helping indebted consumers. Earlier this month, the government reduced bank reserve requirements to free up 30 billion reais ($14.8 billion) in credit. This month, federally controlled Caixa Economica Federal cut rates on its credit card used for home remodeling, and offered new payment grace period options.\nSince August 2011, policy makers have also cut benchmark interest rates by 500 basis points to a record low 7.5 percent, extended tax cuts on consumer goods and pressured commercial banks to lower lending rates. This week, Osasco, Brazil-based Banco Bradesco (BBDC4) SA announced plans to reduce by half interest rates charged on its credit cards. The bank\u2019s preferred stock fell 6.64 percent yesterday on the Sao Paulo exchange.\nThe stimulus measures may be gaining traction. Consumer confidence rose in August for the first time in five months. Retail sales in July beat economists\u2019 forecasts and rose at the second-fastest pace since January, while vehicle sales reached a record high in August.\nConsumer Default\nEven as average loan rates fell, the consumer default rate in August was 7.9 percent, unchanged from July and the highest since 8 percent in November 2009. The company loan default rate rose to 4.1 percent from 4 percent a month ago.\nThe consumer default rate will decline by year-end as wage growth and more caution on the part of banks help to ease indebtedness, Tulio Maciel, head of economic research at the central bank, said to reporters today.\nOutstanding credit rose 1.2 percent in August from the same month last year to 2.2 trillion reais ($1.1 trillion), the central bank said today. Credit expanded 17 percent from a year ago. The central bank boosted its forecast for credit growth this year to 16 percent from 15 percent, Maciel said.\nSwap rates on the contract maturing in January 2014 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.72 percent at 3:23 p.m. local time. The real declined 0.2 percent to 2.0338 per dollar.\nBrazil\u2019s economy expanded at an annualized 1.64 percent in the second quarter, less than the U.S. and Japan . This month, Finance Minister Guido Mantega reduced his 2012 growth forecast to 2 percent from 3 percent, adding that the economy will expand more than 4 percent next year.

Talks are in an early stage and may not result in a deal, the people said.\nSete Brasil plans to spend about $27 billion by 2020 building deep-water drilling vessels that will be rented by Petroleo Brasileiro in so-called pre-salt fields off Brazil\u2019s southern coast. The reservoirs are under about 6,500 feet (1,981 meters) of water and beneath 16,400 feet of sub-sea bedrock, sand and salt.

Inflation was 5.24 percent through August.\nThe wage battle, which shut banks for three weeks in 2011, may last even longer this year as lenders seek to contain expenses amid pressure from President Dilma Rousseff to cut consumer loan rates. Record-low unemployment and rising profit at banks are bolstering union demands for pay increases that top inflation.\n\u201cThe strike this year will be tougher than last year,\u201d said Juvandia Moreira, president of the union representing bank workers in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area. \u201cBanks are offering us much less than the average pay raise that workers were granted\u201d in other industries.\nItau rose 1 percent to 34.01 reais ($16.80) in Sao Paulo at 11:45 a.m. and Bradesco advanced 0.8 percent to 35.70 reais. The Bovespa benchmark index gained 1 percent. Itau fell 0.9 percent this year before today, compared with a 15 percent gain for Bradesco and an 8.9 percent increase in the Bovespa index.\n\u2018Won\u2019t Rest\u2019\nBradesco, based in Osasco, declined to comment, according to an e-mailed statement. Itau, based in Sao Paulo, didn\u2019t return e-mails and a phone call for comment.\nRousseff is pushing lenders to lower loan costs for consumers after the central bank reduced the benchmark interest rate by 5 percentage points since August 2011, the most of any Group of 20 nation. She used a Sept. 6 Independence Day speech to step up her criticism of the banks, saying they\u2019re making too much money.\n\u201cBanks, lenders and especially credit cards can cut rates charged to the final consumer even more, reducing their profits to civil levels,\u201d Rousseff said. \u201cI won\u2019t rest until I see that happen.\u201d\nItau\u2019s second-quarter profit excluding extraordinary items rose 8.1 percent from a year earlier to 3.6 billion reais. Bradesco posted a profit of 2.87 billion reais, up 1.5 percent.\nBanks probably won\u2019t raise their proposal much higher because their return on equity is falling as the government pushes for lower spreads, Karina Freitas, an analyst at brokerage Concordia Corretora in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone interview.\nDeclining Returns\nReturn on equity for Itau fell to 18 percent at the end of the second quarter from 21 percent a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bradesco\u2019s return dropped to 19 percent from 23 percent.\nFenaban, the nation\u2019s banking association, has faith that banks and workers will reach an agreement, said Magnus Apostolico, the group\u2019s director of labor relations. Clients can still use ATM machines, internet and mobile banking services during the strike.\n\u201cWe made an initial proposal that was an improvement relative to the previous years, so we believe an agreement can be reached very fast,\u201d Apostolico said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe continue to ask them to show us where they think our proposal can be improved so the banks can work on it.\u201d\nBank workers have gone on strike every year for the past eight, and 2011\u2019s work stoppage shut branches for 21 days, the most since a 30-day stoppage in 2004. Last year, bank workers won a 9 percent raise.\nOutpacing Inflation\nIn the first half of this year, 97 percent of employees covered by collective-bargaining agreements won pay raises that outpaced consumer-price increases, the most since at least 1996, according to a survey published last month by Dieese, a trade union research institute.\nThe labor dispute probably won\u2019t affect banking shares, Fausto Gouveia, who helps manage 380 million reais at Legan Administracao de Recursos in Sao Paulo. Investors are already factoring in any impact on operations because strikes in Brazil are so widespread, he said.\nInterest rates on consumer loans have fallen to the lowest in five years relative to what banks pay on savings and deposits. The difference, or spread, between deposit and lending rates narrowed to 23 percent in July from 28 percent in February, according to the central bank.\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to reach an accord with what the banks have so far put on the table,\u201d said Clemente Ganz Lucio, Dieese\u2019s technical director. \u201cA real wage increase of half a percent is very low for a sector that has such high profits.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Francisco Marcelino in S\u00e3o Paulo at mdeoliveira@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jessica Brice at jbrice1@bloomberg.net\nWorkers at Itau Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA , Brazil\u2019s biggest banks by market value, are preparing for the longest strike in almost a decade as lenders rebuff demands for raises twice the rate of inflation.

The fund last month offered to buy back $1.6 billion of bonds at discounted prices as part of a recapitalization plan, and was overseeing efforts to find a buyer for the company, which specialized in making loans backed by paychecks.\nCruzeiro do Sul was the sixth lender to need emergency help from regulators since 2010, prompting investors including Precise Securities\u2019 Carlos Legaspy to say they were becoming skeptical of all mid-sized banks in Brazil . In July, the government allowed such lenders to increase sales of debt backed by the FGC to help shore up their finances.\nTakeover talks with Banco Santander Brasil SA fell apart when negotiators couldn\u2019t reach agreement on guarantees for hidden problems that might arise at Cruzeiro do Sul after a deal was struck, Valor Economico newspaper reported earlier today, without saying where it got the information.\nBuyback Fails\nThe FGC said today that investors representing 88.7 percent of Cruzeiro do Sul\u2019s bonds agreed to the buyback, just short of the 90 percent participation the fund was requiring. The default is the biggest in Latin America since Telefonica de Argentina SA failed to pay on $2.9 billion of debt in 2002, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s .\nRegulators today also liquidated Banco Prosper SA, the lender Cruzeiro do Sul said it would acquire in December, and said they would continue to probe fraud allegations and punish anyone found responsible.\n\u201cIt is quite healthy to have this kind of reminder every once in awhile that doesn\u2019t pose a systemic threat,\u201d said Pedro Bastos, chief executive officer of HSBC Global Asset Management in Brazil, in a phone interview from Sao Paulo. \u201cIt\u2019s an important reminder that risk and return need to be in line with the investor\u2019s profile.\u201d\nCruzeiro do Sul yesterday jumped 25 percent in Sao Paulo trading after the FGC extended the deadline for its bond buyback offer through 6 p.m. Sao Paulo time.

Bernanke said he wouldn\u2019t rule out more stimulus and a report showed Brazil\u2019s economy grew at the fastest pace in a year.\nThe real appreciated 0.9 percent to 2.0308 per dollar, the biggest one-day gain since Aug. 3. The currency advanced 1.3 percent this month. Swap rates on contracts due in January rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.27 percent.\nBrazil\u2019s gross domestic product expanded 0.4 percent in the second quarter, four times the revised 0.1 percent first-quarter increase, the national statistics agency reported. The median forecast of 51 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for 0.5 percent growth.\n\u201cThe second-quarter numbers show a faint recovery,\u201d Luciano Rostagno , the chief strategist at Banco WestLB do Brazil SA, said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo . \u201cThird-quarter numbers should be even better.\u201d\nThe real briefly pared its advance and then extended gains after Bernanke said he wouldn\u2019t rule out further bond purchases to boost growth and reduce unemployment, which he called a \u201cgrave concern.\u201d Two rounds of large-scale asset purchases totaling $2.3 trillion have so far failed to reduce the jobless rate to less than 8 percent.\nThe currency rallied with most of its emerging-market peers as Bernanke\u2019s comment on further stimulus boosted risk appetite and stronger growth figures fueled speculation the central bank will soon stop cutting borrowing costs, said Deives Ribeiro, the head of foreign-exchange trading at Fair Corretora de Cambio e Valores.\n\u2018Dollars to Brazil\u2019\n\u201cThe market believes the economic environment is going to get better,\u201d Ribeiro said by phone from Sao Paulo. \u201cWith the rate cuts ending, investors may begin calculating how much they gain by bringing dollars to Brazil.\u201d\nBrazil\u2019s government will keep taking action to weaken the real to help local manufacturers, Finance Minister Guido Mantega said this week in Brasilia.\nThe real is \u201cconsolidating\u201d at a level weaker than 2 reais per dollar thanks to the government\u2019s policy to stem its advance as other countries try to gain an advantage through devaluation, Mantega said.\nThe currency has declined 8.1 percent against the greenback in 2012, the biggest drop among the dollar\u2019s 16 most-traded counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.\nTarget Lending Rate\nThe central bank reduced the target lending rate at this week\u2019s Copom meeting by a half-percentage point to a record low 7.50 percent. If there is room for an additional adjustment, it \u201cshould be carried out with maximum parsimony,\u201d the central bank said in a statement.\nThe government has cut payroll taxes and lowered levies on cars and appliances to kickstart growth, which is trailing that of Russia, India and China .\nSwap rate contracts maturing before January 2015 climbed while longer-term rates fell on speculation higher borrowing costs in 2013 will cool inflation in succeeding years, said Newton Rosa , the chief economist at SulAmerica Investimentos in Sao Paulo.\n\u201cThe market is still responding to the Copom meeting,\u201d Rosa said in a telephone interview.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Josue Leonel in em S\u00e3o Paulo at jleonel@bloomberg.net ; Gabrielle Coppola in Sao Paulo at gcoppola@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Papadopoulos at papadopoulos@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:37:57", "post_time": "2012-08-31 17:36:45", "author": "Josue Leonel , Gabrielle Coppola", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-31/brazilian-real-advances-on-economic-expansion-swap-rates-rise.html", "title": "Brazilian Real Advances on Economic Expansion; Swap Rates Rise", "post_date": "2012-08-31", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "0047ccaa5f07cc4a6161c239362c31113a6fea82"}, {"content": "Bradesco Is Top Pick as BlackRock Buys Banks: Corporate Brazil\nBy Fabiola Moura and Josue Leonel - 2012-08-31T17:48:19Z\nThe one stock Brazil analysts say investors should buy is Banco Bradesco SA. (BBDC4)\nOf the 24 analysts that rate Bradesco, the second-largest bank in Latin America by market value, 18 recommend buying, the most of any company on the benchmark Bovespa index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3) and Itau Unibanco Holding SA, the biggest lender by market value, rank fourth and sixth among the index\u2019s 67 members .\nBlackRock Inc. (BLK) and Citigroup Inc. (C) say bank stocks will post the biggest gains in the second half of the year after Brazil cut the benchmark lending rate to record low, which should help lower default rates from a 30-month high. Policy makers led by central bank President Alexandre Tombini have cut the overnight rate by 5 percentage points to 7.5 percent in the past 12 months, more than any other Group of 20 nation.\n\u201cMy biggest overweight is banks and consumer discretionary , because valuations are still attractive for those sectors,\u201d said Jason Press, a Citigroup strategist for Latin America in New York, in a telephone interview. \u201cWe expect a consumer-led reacceleration of the Brazilian economy in the second half of this year.\u201d\nRelative Value\nBradesco trades at 12 times earnings, compared with 11 for Itau (ITUB4) and 5.9 for Banco do Brasil, according to Bloomberg data. The MSCI World/Banks Index is at a ratio of 15.\nBradesco, based in Osasco, gained 9.6 percent this year before today, putting its market value at 117 billion reais ($57 billion). Itau fell 4.4 percent and Banco do Brasil lost 1.3 percent. The Bovespa index rose 0.9 percent.\nBradesco fell 1.3 percent to 33.25 reais at 2:37 p.m. in the Sao Paulo trading, while Itau fell 1.8 percent to 31.92 reais and Banco do Brasil fell 1.4 percent to 22.14 reais.\nAfter Bradesco, the Brazilian stocks that have the most buy recommendations are shopping-mall operator BR Malls Participacoes SA (BRML3) and retailer Cia Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar (PCAR4) SA.\nBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff is cutting taxes, reducing interest rates and licensing infrastructure projects to lure $66 billion of investments as part of stimulus efforts.\nGrowth in Brazil, the world\u2019s largest developing economy after China , accelerated to 0.4 percent in the second quarter from the previous three months, the fastest pace in a year, the national statistics agency said today.\nBradesco declined to comment, according to an e-mail sent by its press office.\nEconomic Stimulus\nThe monetary and fiscal stimulus should start to produce an effect in the second half the year, said Landers, who is also overweight in Brazilian consumer stocks. Interest-rate cuts have helped to fuel an 18 percent expansion in July outstanding credit to 2.18 trillion reais, according to a central bank report yesterday.\n\u201cThe second half has to be better than the first one with all this government stimuli,\u201d Landers said in a telephone interview from Princeton, New Jersey . \u201cAs the economy continues with full employment and salaries rising, consumers will get the urge to go back to consuming at higher levels than in the past year.\u201d\nItau and Bradesco SA both boosted provisions for soured loans this year as rising inflation and slower economic growth eroded customers\u2019 ability to make payments on time. In February, Itau Chief Executive Officer Roberto Setubal also told reporters that delinquencies may rise to 5 percent by the middle of this year. Rogerio Calderon, Itau\u2019s head of investor relations , said on an April 24 earnings conference call the rate may rise for the next two quarters before falling at year-end.\nWeak Growth Outlook\nWhile banking shares may recover, they won\u2019t outperform the market because economic growth isn\u2019t strong, said Flavio Barros, a fund manager with Grau Gestao de Ativos, which oversees about 380 million reais in Sao Paulo .\n\u201cOn average I expect banking stocks to move in tandem with the broader market,\u201d Barros said in a telephone interview.\nThe consumer default rate rose to 7.9 percent in July from 7.8 percent in June, according to the central bank. The company loan default rate was unchanged last month at 4 percent. Tulio Maciel, the central bank\u2019s chief economist, said yesterday default rates will decline as wages rise.\nLower interest rates and a more cautious approach from the banks to consumer lending may reduce pressure on default rates in the second quarter, BlackRock\u2019s Landers said.\n\u201cThe worst is over,\u201d said Landers, adding that BlackRock has \u201cimportant\u201d positions in Bradesco, Itau and Banco do Brasil. \u201cGrowth rates will be slower, but nothing indicates that Brazil \u2019s middle-class expansion story is at risk.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Fabiola Moura in Sao Paulo at fdemoura@bloomberg.net ; Josue Leonel in em S\u00e3o Paulo at jleonel@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jessica Brice at jbrice1@bloomberg.net ; Helder Marinho at hmarinho@bloomberg.net\nBradesco Is Top Pick as BlackRock Buys Banks\nDado Galdieri/Bloomberg\nCustomers use a Banco Bradesco SA automated teller machine in the Vila Olimpia district of Sao Paulo.\nCustomers use a Banco Bradesco SA automated teller machine in the Vila Olimpia district of Sao Paulo.

(BG) to Sao Martinho SA (SMTO3) propose building plants in Brazil to convert crops into chemicals for products as varied as face cream and industrial lubricants.\nA joint venture between Bunge and U.S. biotechnology company Solazyme Inc. (SZYM) will start late next year to produce oils from sugar. Cane grower Paraiso Bioenergia SA will open the first plant in Brazil by year-end with Emeryville, California- based Amyris Inc. to make raw materials including a substitute for shark liver oil used in lotions. Sao Martinho and ETH Bioenergia SA are planning similar facilities within the next two years.\nThe business of converting crops into renewable chemicals, facing skepticism from some global investors, is becoming more attractive in Brazil after prices for sugar fell 13 percent in the past year and ethanol slumped 12 percent. Amyris dropped 74 percent this year through yesterday after it delayed the Sao Martinho plant and on concern its projects will fail to reach the scale needed to turn a profit. Solazyme is down 12 percent.\n\u201cThis is an incredible opportunity for cane mills if the technology is right,\u201d Steven Slome, a consultant at the San Francisco-based energy-research and power-management company Nexant Inc. , said in a telephone interview. Companies \u201cmay be able to make twice the revenue from the same feedstock.\u201d\nSao Martinho rose 2.2 percent to 24.49 reais at 11:01 a.m. in Sao Paulo, and has gained 46 percent this year. Bunge fell 0.3 percent to $68.72 in New York.\nBioengineered Algae\nSao Paulo-based Sao Martinho and Paraiso Bioenergia are implementing Amyris\u2019s systems at facilities that will use designer microbes to convert sucrose, the main ingredient in cane, into farnesene, a compound that may be processed into a variety of specialty chemicals. Solazyme\u2019s technology uses bioengineered algae, which feeds on sugar in fermentation tanks, to produce oils custom-tailored for specific chemicals.\nCosan SA Industria & Comercio, which controls the world\u2019s biggest sugar-cane processor with Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , and Tereos Internacional SA (TERI3) \u2019s Guarani SA are both considering similar ventures, the biotech company said in 2009.\nWhile the market for these chemicals is small, companies are betting the nascent technology will take off in Brazil because of its sunny climate, abundance of sugar-cane mills and demand for chemicals. Brazil is the world\u2019s largest sugar-cane grower.\nRenewable chemicals made from cane will compete with products derived from petroleum and may sell for more than $20 a liter, compared with about 50 cents a liter for ethanol, Slome said.\n\u2018Double the Margins\u2019\n\u201cCompared to the old commodity business, this is much better for us,\u201d Paraiso Bioenergia Chief Executive Officer Dario Costa Gaeta said in a telephone interview from Brotas, Brazil, where the company is based. \u201cOur target is to have double the margins\u201d of sugar and ethanol, he said.\nNet sales for Brazil\u2019s chemical industry more than doubled to $158.5 billion last year from $72.3 billion in 2005, according to the Brazilian Chemical Industry Association, based in Sao Paulo.\nAmyris plunged to a record low in May after it delayed the Sao Martinho plant and reported losses that were wider than analysts expected.\nAmyris \u201chasn\u2019t been clear in outlining technical hurdles that the company faces,\u201d Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates Inc., said in a telephone interview from Houston. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk associated with all fermentation scale-ups.\u201d\n100 Million Liters\nSao Martinho formed the joint venture with Amyris Inc. (AMRS) in April 2010. The biotech company\u2019s CEO John Melo has said it will eventually be able to produce 100 million liters (26.4 million gallons) of farnesene a year.\nThat project was delayed while Amyris focuses on its venture with Paraiso Bioenergia, Sao Martinho CEO Fabio Venturelli, who worked for Dow Chemical Co. for 22 years, said in an interview. Development may resume in July and it may take 18 months to complete.\nAmyris invested as much as $80 million in the Paraiso Bioenergia facility, Gaeta said.\nAmyris is supplying fuel processed from farnesene to four bus fleets in Sao Paulo and one in Rio de Janeiro, Adilson Liebsch, marketing director for Amyris\u2019s Brazil unit, said in an interview.\nSolazyme, based in South San Francisco, California , expects to open a $145 million plant at Bunge\u2019s Moema sugar-cane mill in the fourth quarter of next year that will produce 100,000 tons of its algal oil a year, Miguel Oliveira, Bunge\u2019s executive director of global innovation, said in a telephone interview.\nSolazyme expects to achieve gross margins of 30 percent or more, according to its Chief Financial Officer Tyler Painter\nPalm-Kernel Oil\nThe algal oil contains lauric acid, which can be processed into detergents and replaces palm-kernel oil, which sells for as much as $1,800 a ton, Oliveira said. The domestic market for the oil may reach 400,000 tons a year, he said.\nOther biotechnology companies including LS9 Inc., Green Biologics Ltd. and Cobalt Technologies Inc. are also planning cane-based chemical ventures in Brazil. Local petrochemical company Braskem SA (BRKM5) already produces a raw material for plastic from the crop at a facility in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul.\nSugar-cane fields in Brazil yielded on average 79 metric tons a hectare in 2010, compared to about 70 tons in both India , the world\u2019s second biggest producer, and in the U.S., the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization said on its website .\n\u201cBrazil, with its low-cost feedstock, is at the very least a proving ground for biotechnology,\u201d Nexant\u2019s Slome said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t make it with Brazil costs, you can\u2019t make it anywhere.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Stephan Nielsen in Sao Paulo at snielsen8@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jessica Brice at jbrice1@bloomberg.net ; Reed Landberg at landberg@bloomberg.net\nSugar Makers Bunge to Sao Martinho Try Biotech: Corporate Brazil\nDado Galdieri/Bloomberg\nThe business of converting crops into renewable chemicals, facing skepticism from some global investors, is becoming more attractive in Brazil after prices for sugar fell 13 percent in the past year and ethanol slumped 12 percent.\nThe business of converting crops into renewable chemicals, facing skepticism from some global investors, is becoming more attractive in Brazil after prices for sugar fell 13 percent in the past year and ethanol slumped 12 percent.

U.S. same-store sales excluding Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) rose 4.1 percent in March from a year earlier, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers . Simon, an Indianapolis-based real estate investment trust, is also expanding overseas to increase growth. It bought a 28.7 percent stake in European shopping-center operator Klepierre SA for about $2 billion last month.\n\u201cThis quarter, the clear kind of take-away is its international ambitions,\u201d Craig Guttenplan, an analyst at New York-based CreditSights Inc., said in a telephone interview before earnings were announced. \u201cThe company is largely saturated in the U.S.\u201d\nFirst-quarter FFO climbed to $648.7 million, or $1.82 a share, from $570.6 million, or $1.61, a year earlier. That exceeds $1.68 a share, the average of 20 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue climbed 9.7 percent to $1.12 billion.\nBrazil, China\nSimon and BR Malls Participacoes SA (BRML3) , based in Rio de Janeiro , said on April 9 that they formed a joint venture to develop outlet centers in Brazil . In March, the company agreed to develop an outlet mall in the Pudong area of Shanghai with Bailian Group, a retail-property operator in China . The Bailian partnership also allows the companies to build more projects in the country.\nU.S. occupancy increased to 93.6 percent in the first quarter from 93 percent a year ago.

Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) and OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3) followed crude lower. Homebuilder Gafisa SA (GFSA3) slid after reporting a fourth-quarter loss.\nThe Bovespa fell 1.9 percent to 61,738.28 at the close of trading in Sao Paulo. Fifty-four stocks dropped while 12 advanced. It was the second-worst performer among emerging- markets benchmarks behind Saudi Arabia \u2019s Tadawul All Share Index. Global stocks fell as a surge in Spanish and Italian bond yields fueled concern Europe\u2019s debt crisis is worsening.\nA customs bureau report today showed China\u2019s inbound shipments increased 5.3 percent in March, below the 9 percent median estimate among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg and the 39.6 percent jump in February.\n\u201cChina\u2019s trade report brought some bad news for Brazil,\u201d Clodoir Vieira, an economist at brokerage Souza Barros Corretora, said by phone from Sao Paulo . \u201cChina is a very important buyer of Brazilian goods, and the risk of a deeper slowdown over there seems to be increasing.\u201d\nCrude for May delivery fell to an eight-week low on the New York Mercantile Exchange on projections that U.S. stockpiles rose to the highest level for this time of year since 1990 and after the customs bureau said China\u2019s net crude imports declined 6 percent in March.\nVale dropped 1.1 percent to 40.32 reais. OGX fell 7.3 percent to 13.16 reais. Petrobras, as Petroleo Brasileiro is known, lost 1.9 percent to 21.19 reais.\nChina Growth Concern\nThe Bovespa has fallen 12 percent in dollar terms since March 5, when China said it would lower its growth target to 7.5 percent for 2012, down from a target of 8 percent annually over the past seven years. Brazil \u2019s benchmark gauge was the fourth- worst performer among 94 major equity indexes tracked by Bloomberg in the period.\nThe real weakened as much as 1.1 percent today after Finance Minister Guido Mantega said during an event in Sao Paulo that Brazil will keep taking steps to prevent its currency from strengthening against the dollar and hurting manufacturers.\nThe government\u2019s attempts to curb currency gains won\u2019t be enough to shore up growth and will end up driving investors away from Brazilian equities, said Christopher Palmer , who helps manage $2.5 billion of assets as director of global emerging markets for Henderson Global Investors Ltd. High borrowing costs are still one of the main reasons to stop the economy from growing faster, according to Palmer.\nCurrency Outlook\n\u201cWhile the rest of the world is trying to deal with so many other problems, Brazil\u2019s first and foremost issue is the level of the real, which is really not the primary reason why the Brazilian economy is slowing down,\u201d Palmer said by phone from London . \u201cThe Brazilian government is not doing anyone any favors by, in the middle of what is still a very weak market in Europe, and with the economy not so strong in China, coming out and talking about a weaker currency as the answer. That\u2019s clearly not the answer.\u201d\nSpanish bonds slumped today after Economy Minister Luis de Guindos declined to rule out a rescue and Bank of Spain Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez said the nation\u2019s lenders may need more capital if the economy weakens more than expected.

Policy makers have lowered interest rates , cut taxes and increased subsidized credit to ensure growth accelerates to 4.5 percent this year from 2.7 percent last year.\nGafisa, Brazil\u2019s fifth-biggest homebuilder by revenue, slid 1.7 percent to 4.03 reais. The company posted a consolidated net loss of 1.03 billion reais ($562 million) in the last three months of 2011, which compares with a loss of 14.1 million reais a year earlier, according to a regulatory filing today.\nBR Malls Participacoes SA (BRML3) , Brazil\u2019s biggest owner of shopping malls, gained 1.2 percent to 24.12 reais. The company signed an agreement with Indianapolis-based Simon Property Group Inc., the largest U.S. mall owner, to form a joint venture to develop outlet centers in Latin America \u2019s biggest economy, according to a statement from Simon.\nYear-to-Date Performance\nBrazil\u2019s benchmark equity measure has gained 8.8 percent this year, buoyed by local interest-rate cuts, signs of growth in the U.S. and speculation Europe may be closer to resolving its debt crisis.

Brazilian apparel retailer Cia. Hering (HGTX3) lost the most since Sept. 22 as the Bovespa touched a 12-week low.\nChina reported an unexpected trade surplus last month as import growth trailed forecasts. March exports rose 8.9 percent from a year earlier, after an 18.4 percent increase in February, the customs bureau said in a statement on its website today. U.S. employers added 85,000 fewer jobs in March than economists projected, the Labor Department said April 6, when most European markets were closed.\n\u201cThe Chinese economy is weakening, since domestic demand is heading to the downside,\u201d Daniel Lenz, chief emerging-market strategist at DZ Bank AG in Frankfurt , said by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s the combination of a lot of negative things, first there is China, secondly there is the U.S. after last week\u2019s worse-than-expected job data. Since markets were closed for a couple of days they are now pricing this negative news in.\u201d\nEmerging-market stocks have advanced 11 percent this year, outperforming developed-country shares on the MSCI World Index, which has gained 6.5 percent.

The second-quarter showed Magazine Luiza, which sells consumer electronics and furniture, started generating results from its two acquisitions , Lojas Maia and Bau da Felicidade, in the past two years, said Daniela Bretthauer , a retail analyst at Raymond James in Sao Paulo.\nTrajano expects sales growth to pick up in 2013 as a decline in loan delinquencies spurs consumers to buy more durable goods. Economic growth in Brazil , the world\u2019s largest developing economy after China , probably will quicken to 4 percent next year from an estimated 1.6 percent this year, according to a central bank weekly survey of economists.\nMagazine Luiza\u2019s same-store sales growth probably will slow to 15 percent this year from 16.5 percent in 2011, she said. The industry will post revenue growth of about 7 percent this year, said Trajano. Her aunt Luiza Trajano and uncle Pelegrino Jose Donato founded the company in 1957, and Luiza Helena took over the retailer\u2019s management in 1991.\nGovernment Stimulus\nRetailers are benefiting from President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s stimulus measures. Last month the government extended tax breaks for goods including furniture, appliances and automobiles in an effort to revive growth. Brazilian retail sales increased 1.4 percent in July, the second-fastest month-on-month pace since January, according to a government report yesterday.\nThe tax cuts will prevent Magazine Luiza from posting a bigger decline in sales growth this year, Trajano said.\nThe 20 percent gain for Magazine Luiza in the past month before today compares with a 17 percent increase in B2W Cia Global do Varejo (BTOW3) , an online retailer, and a 8.7 percent increase in Marisa Lojas SA (AMAR3) , an apparel retail chain. Lojas Renner SA gained 6.7 percent and Lojas Americanas SA (LAME4) rose 2.4 percent.\nMagazine Luiza trades at 15 times its estimated future earnings, the lowest among retailers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Marisa trades at 17, while Lojas Renner\u2019s ratio is 20 and Lojas Americanas\u2019 is 26.\nProfitability\nSecond-quarter net income of 21.9 million reais ($10.8 million) beat analysts estimates, according to Bloomberg data, driving gains in the stock. Earning before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization equaled 4.7 percent of 2011 revenue, the lowest among Brazilian peers, according to Bloomberg data. Cia Hering (HGTX3) \u2019s Ebitda margin was 29 percent, while Marisa\u2019s was 16 percent and Lojas Americanas\u2019 ran at 13.\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t have what we want in terms of profitability, but we will in terms of revenue,\u201d said Trajano, sporting a black silk blouse. \u201cThis year we\u2019re paying the price because when you make acquisitions and invest, you suffer for the first two or three years.\u201d\nMagazine Luiza and its shareholders raised 805 million reais last April in an initial public offering. Since then, its shares have fallen 18 percent. This year, the stock is up 38 percent, compared with a 9 percent gain for the benchmark Bovespa stock index.\n\u2018Turnaround Story\u2019\nFive of ten analysts that cover Magazine Luiza have a buy recommendation, while four say hold and one says sell, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t doing well because of the macroeconomic environment and because of the acquisitions of Maia and Bau,\u201d said Raymond James\u2019s Bretthauer, who rates Magazine Luiza equivalent to buy, in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a turnaround story for 2013 but we will gradually see improvement this year.\u201d\nMagazine Luiza plans to open 15 new stores before the end of the year, bringing its total number to 749, Trajano said. The company won\u2019t make any acquisitions until the middle of 2013, she said.\n\u201cThis is the year of consolidation,\u201d Trajano said. \u201cWe won\u2019t buy anything, sadly for me, but at the same time it was a decision that I helped to make.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Leonardo Lara in Sao Paulo at llara1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Adriana Arai at aarai1@bloomberg.net ; Helder Marinho at hmarinho@bloomberg.net\nPedestrians Pass A Magazine Luiza SA Store\nPaulo Fridman/Bloomberg\nMagazine Luiza SA Chief Executive Officer Luiza Helena Trajano is damping her desire to buy companies after the retailer\u2019s last two acquisitions failed to produce the level of profit she sought.\nMagazine Luiza SA Chief Executive Officer Luiza Helena Trajano is damping her desire to buy companies after the retailer\u2019s last two acquisitions failed to produce the level of profit she sought.

Global do Varejo is posting the biggest losses among major online retailers worldwide as delivery delays push customers toward competitors.\nB2W, the Rio de Janeiro-based unit of Lojas Americanas SA (LAME4) , reported a net loss of $76.6 million in the 12 months through March, the worst result of the 20 biggest peers globally, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The 13-year-old company lost $3.08 for every $100 in revenue in the period, according to the data .\nChief Executive Officer Anna Saicali is missing out on a surge in consumer spending in the world\u2019s second-largest developing economy after authorities ordered sales to be suspended twice in the past 12 months amid complaints that B2W failed to fulfill orders on time. The erosion in customers\u2019 confidence comes as competitors lure shoppers away with lower prices and on-time deliveries, said Leonardo Zanfelicio, an analyst at brokerage Concordia Corretora.\n\u201cB2W didn\u2019t have the logistics it needed to keep up with the sudden growth we saw in the e-commerce sector in Brazil in the past few years,\u201d Zanfelicio, who rates the stock hold, said by telephone from Sao Paulo. \u201cThe customer can literally go to a competitor without even leaving the desk. And if the competitor sells at a lower price and delivers on time, why would this client go back to B2W?\u201d\nThe stock dropped 77 percent in Sao Paulo in the 12 months through yesterday, the biggest plunge on the benchmark Bovespa index, which fell 17 percent. The MSCI Brazil/Consumer Discretionary Index sank 47 percent in the same period, with clothing retailer Cia. Hering\u2019s 8.5 percent gain the best performance on the measure.\nB2W jumped 6.5 percent to 5.38 reais at 12:47 p.m. in Sao Paulo today, as companies that depend on domestic demand rallied after a report showing slower inflation in Brazil spurred speculation policy makers will have more room to lower borrowing costs.\nWashing Machines\nB2W said in an e-mailed statement that it is investing to make its delivery system more reliable.\nThe company, which owns eight websites that sell everything from washing machines to theater tickets, trades at a price-to- book ratio of 0.72, down from 28.5 in October 2007. The ratio for the MSCI Brazil/Consumer Discretionary Index is 1.92, compared with 5.96 in December 2007.\nB2W was founded in 1999 under the name Submarino SA and raised 543.9 million reais ($269.5 million) in an initial public offering in 2005. Lojas Americanas, a Rio de Janeiro-based retailer that was backed by investors including Brazilian billionaire Carlos Alberto Sicupira, bought Submarino in December 2006 and merged it with its own online unit to form B2W. Shares have tumbled 90 percent since the acquisition.\nCompetition\n\u201cWhen the company still operated just under the Submarino brand, it was virtually the only big player in the industry,\u201d Marcelo Varejao, an analyst at Socopa Corretora brokerage, said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. \u201cNow retailers that used to sell only through brick-and-mortar units are getting more aggressive with their Internet sales , and they have synergies that B2W doesn\u2019t have, which means they can sell at lower prices.\u201d\nNine out of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg recommend selling the stock, while none rate the company a buy. Varejao doesn\u2019t rate B2W and has a recommendation equivalent to buy for Lojas Americanas.\nIncome Gains\nBrazil\u2019s biggest retailers are boosting online sales as consumer income and Internet penetration increases. Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar , Brazil\u2019s top retailer by market value, said sales in its online unit increased 21 percent in the first quarter. Pao de Acucar\u2019s shares jumped 14 percent in the past 12 months through yesterday.\nMagazine Luiza SA (MGLU3) , a Brazilian electronics and furniture retailer, reported its Internet sales increased 43 percent to 249 million reais in the first quarter from a year earlier. Its shares are down 47 percent in the past 12 months through yesterday.\nThe increase in competition comes after B2W, which uses private services and the national postal system to make deliveries, was forced to suspend sales twice in Brazil\u2019s biggest states following customer complaints about shipping delays.\nSao Paulo\u2019s consumer protection agency, known as Procon, suspended B2W\u2019s sales for 72 hours starting March 15 in Brazil\u2019s largest state, saying it received 6,233 complaints about the company, according to a statement on the agency\u2019s website. B2W received a court injunction on the same day lifting the ban, the company said in an e-mailed statement that day.\nRio de Janeiro Suspension\nB2W had faced a similar problem in May 2011, when a Rio de Janeiro court suspended sales in the state until there was proof that all issues regarding delivery delays were solved, according to a statement posted on the public prosecutor office\u2019s website . The company received an injunction the next day canceling the suspension.\n\u201cOnce consumers lose confidence in a brand, getting them back is not only expensive, it also takes a lot of time,\u201d Juliana Rozenbaum and Vitor Paschoal, analysts at Banco Itau BBA SA in Sao Paulo, wrote in a note to clients on May 9. \u201cWe still fail to see the light at the end of the tunnel for B2W.\u201d\nThe company said in a statement on May 23 that it is investing in new distribution centers to improve its logistics system and make deliveries faster and more reliable.\n\u201cB2W has continued to invest in optimizing its logistics system,\u201d the company\u2019s press office said yesterday in an e- mailed response to questions. \u201cFor the past few months new equipment in our distribution centers reduced delivery times, and a closer relationship with Brazil\u2019s top transport companies will guarantee the best possible service to our customers.\u201d\nEarnings Outlook\nWhile the company will report weak earnings this year, in the longer term the new distribution centers may help B2W to go back to posting profits, Caue Pinheiro, an analyst at SLW Corretora brokerage, said by phone from Sao Paulo.\n\u201cIt takes time for this kind of investment to bear fruit,\u201d said Pinheiro, who recommends investors sell the shares. \u201cI don\u2019t expect big improvement in this quarter or the next. But B2W seems to be taking steps in the right direction. It acknowledged the problems and it\u2019s trying to correct them.\u201d\nA capital infusion from the parent company might help B2W invest in improving service, said Fausto Gouveia, a portfolio manager at Sao Paulo-based Legan Administracao de Recursos.\n\u201cOne thing that could make the stock attractive again is if some bigger competitor bids for a stake or if Americanas itself decides to put more money in the company,\u201d Gouveia said. \u201cGiven Americanas already put quite a bit of money in B2W last year, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019d be willing to do it again soon.\u201d\nLojas Americanas\nShareholders injected 1 billion reais into B2W in 2011, with 643.5 million reais coming from Lojas Americanas, according to regulatory filings. SLW\u2019s Pinheiro said \u201cit could make sense\u201d for Americanas to take B2W private after the stock\u2019s underperformance in the past year.\nLojas Americanas\u2019s press office didn\u2019t return a phone call and an e-mail seeking comment.\nBrazilian retail sales increased 12.5 percent in March from a year before, the biggest jump in two years. Gross domestic product expanded at an average annual rate of 4.4 percent from 2006 through 2011, while the U.S. grew 0.7 percent a year in the same period. The country\u2019s middle class, defined as households with annual incomes of at least 12,000 reais, swelled by 31 million in the past decade, according to a study from Brazil\u2019s Strategic Affairs Ministry.\n\u201cThe problem for B2W is not lack of demand, as the outlook for the retail industry in Brazil is extremely positive,\u201d Gouveia said. \u201cUnless something very unexpected happens, such as an acquisition by a bigger player in the industry, I don\u2019t see shares recovering any time soon.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ney Hayashi in Sao Paulo at ncruz4@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Papadopoulos at papadopoulos@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:39:41", "post_time": "2012-06-06 11:50:46", "author": "Ney Hayashi", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-06/biggest-online-retail-loss-driven-by-b2w-delivery-delays.html", "title": "Biggest Online Retail Loss Driven by B2W Delivery Delays", "post_date": "2012-06-06", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "8ff6be3cbed9f1d442d4b299282cefcf8074f96a"}, {"content": "Gol Advances as Percentage of Filled Seats Increased in April\nBy Denyse Godoy - 2012-05-17T17:22:04Z\nGol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) , Brazil \u2019s second-biggest airline, rose after it said the average percentage of seats filled by fare-paying customers increased last month.\nShares rose 1.2 percent to 9.59 reais at 2:21 p.m. in Sao Paulo after earlier increasing 4.2 percent, the steepest intraday gain in almost two weeks.

With the Asian company\u2019s stock tumbling since the first report of its interest in the LME, it has now retreated 33 percent in the past year, the biggest decline among the world\u2019s 20 largest exchanges, the data show.\nWhile the merger will give Hong Kong Exchanges control of about 80 percent of global trade in industrial-metal futures as it grapples with falling profits and a slump in initial public offerings, the New York Stock Exchange (NYX) \u2019s head said the price would have been too rich for the biggest U.S. bourse operator. An increase in trading by Chinese companies on the LME is vital to justify the deal, making the takeover\u2019s success dependent on China \u2019s regulators, who have so far resisted granting the LME access to the mainland to protect its rival in Shanghai , according to Core Pacific-Yamaichi International (H.K.) Ltd.\n\u201cIn the short-term, this acquisition will be a huge burden,\u201d Michiya Tomita, a Hong Kong-based fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversees $65 billion, said in a phone interview. \u201cThe valuation they\u2019re buying LME for is expensive. This investment could pay off eventually if they are able to boost China\u2019s trading volumes on LME, but that\u2019s not easy to achieve given current regulatory restrictions.\u201d\nBenchmark Prices\nHong Kong Exchanges, formed a decade ago through the combination of the city\u2019s equity and derivatives markets, has focused on stocks, options and futures on equity indexes and interest rates . The 135-year-old LME, which reported record volume of $15.4 trillion last year, sets global benchmark prices for metals including copper, aluminum and nickel, of which China consumes more than any other nation.\nTrading volume on the LME grew about 58 percent between 2007 and 2011, according to data from the exchange. UBS AG analyst Stephen Andrews forecasts trading will increase to 261 million lots by 2015, from about 147 million lots in 2011, according to a June 18 note.\n\u201cThis deal is about growth over not just one or two years, but over the longer term,\u201d James Fok, chief of staff to Hong Kong Exchanges\u2019 (388) Chief Executive Officer Charles Li, said in a phone interview. \u201cAs a standalone business, LME has quite an attractive growth rate. On top of that, what we\u2019re able to help plug it into are areas of growth that it\u2019s not capturing today - - in particular China -- that are able to boost that growth quite substantially.\u201d\n\u2018Very Well\u2019\n\u201cFrom our point of view we think the valuation stacks up very well,\u201d he said.\nAfter rising as much as 3.3 percent earlier today , Hong Kong Exchanges fell 10 cents to HK$108.60 apiece.\nMiriam Heywood, a spokeswoman for LME, declined to comment on the price Hong Kong Exchanges offered for the firm.\nHong Kong Exchanges said on June 15 it had agreed to pay 1.39 billion pounds ($2.2 billion) for LME, or 181 times the London-based company\u2019s 2011 earnings of 7.68 million pounds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe LME purchase price was almost double the prior record for an exchange deal exceeding $1 billion, the data show. The merger of Sao Paulo-based Bolsa de Mercadorias & Futuros-BM&F SA and Bovespa Holding SA to create Latin America \u2019s biggest stock and futures exchange valued Bovespa at 107 times profit when it was announced in March 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\u2018Limited Relevance\u2019\nThe member-owned LME\u2019s previous profits are \u201cof limited relevance\u201d because the bourse kept fees low for the benefit of its shareholders, Hong Kong Exchanges said in a June 15 statement. Had a fee increase scheduled for next month taken place before 2011, profits would have tripled to 23.8 million pounds last year, it said.\nWith that level of earnings, the takeover would value LME at 58 times profit. That would still leave Hong Kong\u2019s bid as the third-most expensive for a bourse on record, behind the BM&F-Bovespa merger and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange\u2019s October 2006 offer for the Chicago Board of Trade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Bloomberg World Exchanges Index (BNWEXCH) of 25 bourses traded at almost twice its current price-earnings multiple when the deal to create the current Chicago-based CME Group Inc. (CME) was announced, the data show.\n\u201cThe earnings don\u2019t justify the price,\u201d Thomas Monaco , an analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong, said in a telephone interview. \u201cI don\u2019t see it being positive for earnings, which is essentially what the stock trades off of. I think they\u2019ve bitten off much more than they can chew.\u201d\n\u2018Value-Destructive\u2019\nTaking into account the agreement by Hong Kong Exchanges not to raise fees on the LME until 2015, Monaco estimated in a June 18 note that the bourse will have to double the LME\u2019s profits in order to avoid cutting its dividend or selling new shares to finance the deal.\n\u201cThis was a value-destructive deal and the company should not be doing something like this,\u201d Monaco said.\nNYSE Euronext\u2019s CEO Duncan Niederauer said on June 8 that the LME had become too expensive for the operator of the New York Stock Exchange. NYSE Euronext had said in May it was removed from the list of potential buyers.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t going to chase it,\u201d Niederauer said at the Sandler O\u2019Neill Global Exchange and Brokerage Conference in New York. \u201cThe price it\u2019ll likely trade at, frankly, it was too rich in terms of what we were able to afford to pay.\u201d\nLME Shareholders\nHong Kong Exchanges\u2019 bid has left New York-based JPMorgan Chase & Co. poised to more than double the value of its investment in LME shares bought seven months ago from the U.K. unit of bankrupt MF Global Holdings Ltd. The New York-based bank is the biggest investor in the LME with 1.4 million shares valued at 150.6 million pounds after Hong Kong\u2019s offer of 107.60 pounds per ordinary share.\nNew York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) \u2019s stake of 1.23 million shares in LME is valued at 132.3 million pounds. U.K. metals trading companies Metdist Ltd. and Metdist Trading Ltd. have a combined 1.21 million LME shares, valued at about 130 million pounds after the offer.\nHong Kong Exchanges, which had $5.7 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of March, is borrowing 1.1 billion pounds for the purchase and plans to sell stock or bonds to refinance the loans. The company is likely to issue 10 percent of its share capital to raise funds, according to Ivan Li, an analyst at Kim Eng Securities in Hong Kong.\n\u2018Under Pressure\u2019\n\u201cIts share price may be under pressure again at that time,\u201d Li wrote in a June 20 note. Li cut his forecast for Hong Kong Exchange\u2019s 2012 earnings by about 10 percent and the price estimate on the stock to HK$90 a share, or 17 percent below last week\u2019s close .\nWith the announcement of the LME acquisition sending Hong Kong Exchanges to the largest drop in the city\u2019s benchmark Hang Seng Index on June 18, the bourse has now tumbled 33 percent in the past year. That\u2019s a bigger slump than any global exchange with a market value of more than $500 million, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Most of the decline has come since the South China Morning Post newspaper first reported the bourse\u2019s interest in LME in February.\nThe deal price means that Hong Kong Exchanges will have to boost LME\u2019s revenue to at least 400 million pounds, from 61 million pounds in 2011, if it is to meet its own goal of a 10 percent to 15 percent return on investment for the acquisition in five years, UBS\u2019s Andrews said. The purchase is unlikely to make more than a \u201cmid-single digit\u201d return on investment in the next three to five years, according to a June 18 note from Andrews, who factored in the cost of financing and U.K. taxes.\n\u2018Strategic Benefits\u2019\n\u201cThere are clearly strategic benefits for Hong Kong from owning this asset but for HKEx\u2019s shareholders acquisitions need to generate a good return on cash invested to add value,\u201d Andrews wrote. \u201cLME may well come up short of expectations in this regard.\u201d\nHong Kong plans to increase the London exchange\u2019s revenue in part by tapping the large potential base of customers in China, which accounts for about 40 percent of consumption of commodities globally and only as much as 25 percent of trading on the LME, the company said when announcing the deal .\nTo increase trading by Chinese firms, the LME will need permission to register warehouses in mainland China, according to Timothy Li, a Hong Kong-based senior analyst for Core-Pacific Yamaichi. That may not be forthcoming with Chinese regulators interested in protecting the Shanghai Futures Exchange from competition, he said.\nWarehouse Ban\nThe China Securities Regulatory Commission, which is responsible both for regulating trading and developing China\u2019s domestic markets, has prohibited foreign bourses from setting up warehouses for delivery of commodities. The ban is in place until the government issues rules on the opening of futures markets , the CSRC said in a July 2008 statement. The CSRC hasn\u2019t said when that will happen and didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours.\n\u201cWhether you are a producer, user or trader, warehouse delivery is an important part of commodity trading,\u201d Zhang Yifan, a commodity strategist at China Galaxy Securities Co., said by phone from Shanghai. \u201cObstacles for overseas exchanges to set up delivery warehouses in China gives domestic players less incentive to trade on the foreign exchanges.\u201d\nThe CSRC also controls Chinese companies\u2019 ability to trade commodity futures in overseas exchanges, including the LME.\n\u201cThey need to boost LME trades from China,\u201d Core Pacific- Yamaichi\u2019s Li said in a telephone interview. \u201cChina\u2019s interest in protecting the Shanghai Futures Exchange from overseas competition may make this difficult.\u201d\nDeclining Earnings\nBefore Hong Kong Exchanges agreed to the deal for LME, analysts were projecting it would report earnings of about HK$5 billion ($640 million) in 2012, the fifth year of falling or unchanged profits since 2007. The average of analyst forecasts dropped to HK$4.9 billion in the past week, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nHong Kong has accounted for about 5 percent of the global amount raised through new listings this year, compared with 13 percent in 2011 and 18 percent in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe acquisition of LME will have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on Hong Kong\u2019s ability to boost its profits as it increases trading fees and expands its offering of products denominated in renminbi in the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy, according to Simmy Grewal, London-based senior analyst at Aite Group LLC.\n\u2018Very Large\u2019\n\u201cThe potential is very large and that is what Hong Kong is paying for,\u201d Grewal said in a phone interview. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very smart about diversifying to now look at commodities. They didn\u2019t want more exposure to equities, so they realized they needed to diversify and get to a completely different space that also complements the exposure to China because that is something that no other exchange in the world has.\u201d\nWith the takeover unlikely to boost Hong Kong\u2019s earnings in the short-term, investors may still grow more impatient given the uncertainty about the merged entity\u2019s ability to get the necessary access to China, according to Mizuho\u2019s Monaco.\n\u201cThis is a very, very long-term thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be able to get the warehouses in China. We have no idea.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jonathan Burgos in Singapore at jburgos4@bloomberg.net ; Eleni Himaras in Hong Kong at ehimaras@bloomberg.net .\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Daniel Hauck at dhauck1@bloomberg.net ; Katherine Snyder at ksnyder@bloomberg.net ; Nick Gentle at ngentle2@bloomberg.net .\nHong Kong Exchanges\u2019 CEO Charles Li\nJerome Favre/Bloomberg\nCharles Li, chief executive officer of Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.\nCharles Li, chief executive officer of Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.

As the only exchange in Brazil, BM&FBovespa has benefited from daily trading volumes that have climbed 50 percent in the past five years to a 100-day average of $4 billion. That compares with a 49 percent drop in the period for the top exchanges in the world\u2019s 10 biggest stock markets.\nSecurities regulators will meet with market participants in July to discuss competition after commissioning a report that found opening up the market would reduce transaction costs by as much as 8.1 percent. The report , released this week, bolsters bids by Direct Edge Holdings LLC, Bats Global Markets Inc., Cetip SA-Mercados Organizados and IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) to compete against BM&FBovespa.\n\u201cWith more competition, BM&FBovespa\u2019s market share will fall, hurting its growth outlook,\u201d Paulo Ribeiro, an analyst at HSBC, said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo.\nRibeiro, who has the equivalent of a buy recommendation on BM&FBovespa, expects competition to start in 2014, with outside providers capturing 30 percent of equities trading by 2016. Itau analysts including Regina Longo Sanchez expect BM&FBovespa may lose 20 to 30 percent of its share, according to a June 18 research note. Itau has the equivalent of a hold recommendation on the stock.\nFending Off Rivals\nBM&FBovespa, based in Sao Paulo, said it will discuss the report\u2019s findings with Brazil\u2019s securities regulator, known as CVM, before making comments on the issue, according to an e- mailed statement from the exchange\u2019s press office.\nThe Sao Paulo exchange is working to integrate its clearing operations to lower margin requirements by up to 40 percent, which could help the exchange fend off potential competition, Chief Executive Officer Edemir Pinto said in an interview in August. The bourse said in a statement on its website that trading fees in Brazil are in line with other countries.\nThe report \u201cconfirmed what market participants always suspected: trading at BVMF is expensive and there are substantial gains to be extracted from introducing competition,\u201d Banco Santander Brasil SA analysts including Henrique Navarro wrote in a note to clients on June 19.\nMexico, Colombia\nBM&FBovespa\u2019s shares in Sao Paulo have lost 1.5 percent this year, while Bolsa de Valores de Colombia has jumped 10 percent in Bogota and Mexico \u2019s Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB has surged 17 percent. The Brazilian stock trades at 17.8 times its reported earnings, which compares with a ratio of 19.3 percent for the Colombian bourse and 20 for Mexico\u2019s exchange.\nWhile growth in trading volumes slowed to 2 percent in 2011 from 22 percent a year before amid concern about the outlook for the global economy, Brazil still offers attractive opportunities for foreign exchange operators, Ribeiro said. Foreign investors pulled 1.35 billion reais ($655 million) from the Bovespa in 2011, which compares with an inflow of 5.96 billion reais in 2010, according to data from the exchange.\nCetip, whose main businesses include collateral registration and fixed-income securities depository, is seeking permission to act as a clearinghouse for fixed-income securities, according to a regulatory filing on June 20. The company said in an April filing it signed a contract with IntercontinentalExchange to develop an electronic platform to trade fixed-income securities in Brazil. The announcement followed plans by Jersey City , New Jersey-based Direct Edge, the fourth-largest U.S. equity exchange, to start an electronic platform for stocks trading in Rio de Janeiro.\nMonopoly End\nBats and Sao Paulo-based Claritas Investmentos also signed an agreement to work on the creation of a new stock exchange with clearing and depository services in Brazil, according to a statement from Bats in Feb. 2011.\nEnding BM&FBovespa\u2019s monopoly would help spur economic growth, Oxera Consulting Ltd. said in the report commissioned by the CVM and released on June 18.\nWhile the regulator says in a statement on its website the findings don\u2019t necessarily reflect its views on the issue, the report will help it decide if a regulatory change is needed to deal with increased competition. BM&FBovespa is the second- largest exchange operator in the Americas after Chicago-based CME Group Inc., which owns a minority stake in the Brazilian bourse.\nWhile the end of BM&FBovespa\u2019s monopoly would likely drive trading fees lower, the impact on the company\u2019s revenue should be offset by rising trading volumes, said HSBC\u2019s Ribeiro.\n\u201cThe market may be over-reacting a bit when it comes to the effect competition will have on BM&FBovespa,\u201d Ribeiro said. \u201cIt will depend on how BM&FBovespa reacts to this competition. It could adopt a smarter pricing system instead of charging a flat fee to almost all investors.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ney Hayashi in Sao Paulo at ncruz4@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jessica Brice at jbrice1@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:40:18", "post_time": "2012-06-21 23:01:00", "author": "Ney Hayashi", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-22/bm-fbovespa-may-lose-30-share-to-competitors-corporate-brazil.html", "title": "BM&FBovespa; May Lose 30% Share to Competitors: Corporate Brazil", "post_date": "2012-06-21", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "17457d0ab5df6133d75d9c28038391f08e314519"}, {"content": "JBS Shareholders Agree to Swap 118 Million Shares for Vigor\nBy Lucia Kassai - 2012-06-21T20:29:08Z\nJBS SA (JBSS3) shareholders agreed to swap 118 million shares for Vigor Alimentos SA (VIGR3) stock, less than the world\u2019s biggest beef producer sought to exchange as it spins off the dairy unit.\nInvestors received one share of Vigor for each of JBS at an auction held at the BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) securities exchange in Sao Paulo, which disclosed the results by e-mail today.

Now those doubts have been cleared up.\u201d\nCentral bank President Alexandre Tombini cut the lending rate by 4.5 percentage points over the past year to 8 percent, seeking to revive growth in the biggest emerging market after China as Europe \u2019s debt crisis saps the outlook for exports and foreign investment. Should the recovery speed up as Brazil bolsters spending on infrastructure, policy makers may raise the rate to as high as 9 percent by the end of 2013, Levy said.\nConsumer prices as measured by the IPCA index rose 5.2 percent in the year through July, the fastest inflation rate in four months. The figure remains below the 6.5 percent ceiling of the central bank\u2019s target.\nStocks including EcoRodovias Infraestrutura & Logistica SA, the Sao Paulo-based highways and ports operator, and Cia. de Concessoes Rodoviarias , Brazil\u2019s biggest toll-road operator, should keep outperforming the Bovespa equity index as Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff relies more on non-government entities to take on infrastructure improvements, Levy said.\nPorts, Roads\n\u201cBrazil needs more investments in ports, roads and railroads, which means those companies have scope to keep growing,\u201d Levy said.\nBradesco\u2019s Fia Infra Estrutura (BDSINFR) , an investment fund that allocates at least 67 percent of its assests to shares of companies in the infrastructure industry, has advanced 20.6 percent this year, outperforming 90 percent of its peers in Brazil, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Bovespa index has climbed 4.7 percent in the same period.\nBrazil will sell licenses to build and operate roads and railways requiring as much as 133 billion reais in investments over 30 years, Transport Minister Paulo Sergio Passos said during a ceremony in Brasilia on Aug. 15.

Since then, it has plunged 5.9 percent . CCR SA (CCRO3) and EcoRodovias Infraestrutura & Logistica SA, Brazil\u2019s two biggest publicly traded transport infrastructure companies, have gained 34 percent and 24 percent, respectively.\nSao Paulo-based Triunfo, which also has contracts for toll roads, ports and railroads, bid 3.8 billion reais ($1.9 billion) for the Campinas contract, making it the third-most expensive concession since Brazil opened up its airports to private operators last year. Investors are concerned that Triunfo\u2019s expansion into areas where it has little experience, such as airports, may hurt profit margins.\n\u201cThere certainly are uncertainties related to the airport investment, because there\u2019s nothing out there to compare their performance with,\u201d Jacqueline Lison, an analyst at Banco Fator SA, said in phone interview from Sao Paulo on July 23. \u201cThere\u2019s concern in the market that Triunfo\u2019s excess diversification might be harmful to the company.\u201d\nWorld Cup, Olympics\nBrazil\u2019s government is auctioning off concessions for airports, roads and other infrastructure ahead of the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games . For the February auction, Brazilian contractors teamed up with companies in Argentina, France and South Africa to bid 24.5 billion reais for leases for three facilities. President Dilma Rousseff \u2019s government was seeking to raise a minimum of 5.5 billion reais from the auction for the rights to operate the airports that last year accounted for about a third of Brazil\u2019s 179 million passengers and 57 percent of its air cargo.\nBefore today, CCR posted a total return of 34 percent this year, ranking it as the second-best performance in the sector, while Triunfo\u2019s 21 percent drop makes it the worst. Infrastructure company Obrascon Huarte Lain Brasil SA (OHLB3) had the best total return with a 37 percent gain.\nDiversification\n\u201cDiversification surely is one of the reasons for Triunfo\u2019s recent performance,\u201d Sandro Lima, the company\u2019s chief financial officer and investor relations director, said in a telephone interview. \u201cOur task now is to demonstrate this is not a problem, but what sets us apart.\u201d\nFitch Ratings withdrew its negative outlook for Triunfo last month after the ratings company concluded that investments in the next three years won\u2019t hurt its credit quality .\nThe airport in Campinas, known as Viracopos, \u201chas reasonable chances to be profitable and deliver growing margins,\u201d Fitch said in its report on June 28.\nCCR and EcoRodovias\u2019s press officers declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.\nCCR, EcoRodovias\nShareholders may look more favorably on EcoRodovias and CCR because the companies are sticking to their core businesses of toll-road operations and diversifying more slowly, said Felipe Vinagre, an analyst at Barclays Plc. EcoRodovias bid and lost in the February auction, while CCR\u2019s offer was disqualified because it was considered too small.\nTriunfo fell 0.6 percent to 7.95 reais at 3:08 p.m. in Sao Paulo trading, while the Bovespa index rose 0.3 percent. CCR and EcoRodovias lost 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively.\n\u201cCCR diversified a bit, but in a more restricted fashion, as did EcoRodovias,\u201d Vinagre said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. \u201cFor these companies, which are big, it\u2019s easier than for smaller company. Both have very mature concessions and their investments in other business were well received.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jose Sergio Osse in Sao Paulo at josse1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jessica Brice at jbrice1@bloomberg.net ; Helder Marinho at hmarinho@bloomberg.net .\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:40:47", "post_time": "2012-07-30 14:43:48", "author": "Jose Sergio Osse", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-30/triunfo-auction-win-turns-stock-into-loser-corporate-brazil.html", "title": "Triunfo Auction Win Turns Stock Into Loser: Corporate Brazil", "post_date": "2012-07-30", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "f7f3b5484091147c70d7ef25caeda3190bc16f53"}, {"content": "Brazilian Stock Movers: CCR, Embraer, LLX, PDG Realty, Positivo\nBy Denyse Godoy - 2012-05-28T21:25:23Z\nThe following companies had unusual price changes in Sao Paulo trading.

With the concessions fetching five times the minimum bid, their caution may have been wise.\nBrazilian contractors teamed up with companies in Argentina, France and South Africa to bid 24.5 billion reais ($14 billion) yesterday for leases to Sao Paulo\u2019s Guarulhos international airport and two other facilities. The auction marked an about-face for President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, which abandoned its opposition to private investment in the country\u2019s airports as Brazil struggles to upgrade aging terminals in time for the 2014 World Cup .\nShares in the only listed company among the winners, TPI - Triunfo Participacoes e Investimentos, fell as investors saw the premium it offered to pay as too high, while the leaders of two losing consortiums rose. Groups including Flughafen Zuerich AG (FHZN) , Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide (FRA) and operators of London \u2019s Heathrow and Singapore \u2019s airport were also outbid.\n\u201cThey certainly overpaid, particularly for Guarulhos, well beyond what can be considered fair value,\u201d Daniela Bretthauer , an equities analyst with Raymond James , said by telephone from Sao Paulo.\nRousseff\u2019s government was seeking to raise a minimum of 5.5 billion reais from the auction for the rights to operate the three airports that last year accounted for about a third of Brazil\u2019s 179 million passengers last year and 57 percent of its air cargo.\nPolitical Pressure\nInvestimentos e Participacoes em Infra-Estrutura SA teamed up with Airports Co. South Africa to bid 16.2 billion reais for a 20-year lease of Guarulhos. That\u2019s almost 4 billion reais more than the second-highest bid by a group that included Fraport, operator of Frankfurt \u2019s airport, the world\u2019s ninth busiest, according to the Montreal-based Airport Council International .\nThe dominance in the Invepar consortium of employee pension funds linked to state-run companies also raises concern over potential government meddling in the airport\u2019s management, said Mauro Rochlin, professor of economics at the IBMEC business school in Rio de Janeiro .\nRousseff has vowed to keep a safe distance from the airports\u2019 management, and yesterday\u2019s auction was Brazil\u2019s boldest attempt at privatization since the 1990s, when it sold off roads and utilities that suffered from decades of underinvestment. Still, the state will maintain a 49 percent stake in each consortium and via loans from state development bank BNDES will fund much of the improvements.\n\u201cThe question is how much political pressure the new operators will face,\u201d Rochlin said by telephone.\nHigh Premiums\nSao Paulo-based Engevix Engenharia SA and Corporacion America, which operates Argentina \u2019s airports, offered the biggest premium -- more than seven times the 582 million reais minimum bid -- to run the airport in the capital Brasilia for 25 years. The two companies are building an airport near the northeastern city of Natal after winning last year Brazil\u2019s first attempt to attract private investors to the industry.\nShares in Triunfo, which together with Paris-based Egis Avia offered 3.8 billion reais to run Viracopos near Sao Paulo for 30 years, fell 3.3 percent yesterday. In contrast, losing bidders CCR SA and Obrascon Huarte Lain Brasil SA (OHLB3) , both of them Sao Paulo-based builders, rose 2.5 percent and 5.3 percent respectively as the benchmark Bovespa index remained flat.\n\u201cIt removed a heavy weight off the stocks,\u201d Victor Mizusaki, a transportation equities analyst at UBS AG in Sao Paulo, said about the losing bidders. \u201cThe market was worried about what would be the returns if they had won.\u201d\nLosing Bidders\nMadrid-based Ferrovial SA (FER) , which owns the company operating Heathrow, and Changi Airport Group, which manages Singapore\u2019s main airport as well as projects in China and Europe , made losing bids through eight other groups.\nCompany spokesmen from Invepar, Engevix and Triunfo declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News, while Johannesburg-based ACSA didn\u2019t respond to messages seeking comment. Egis Avia couldn\u2019t be reached after market hours.\nInvestments in Brazil\u2019s aging airports have struggled to keep pace with air travel that has doubled in the past decade as incomes in Latin America\u2019s biggest economy have risen. Last year, as the world\u2019s fifth-biggest country by land mass trailed only the U.S. and China in volume of domestic air travel, 1 of 20 flights were canceled compared with 1 in 50 in the U.S.\nTo put an end to crowded hallways and busted escalators, the winning operators are required to invest a total of 16.1 billion reais in the three airports, including building a new terminal in Guarulhos to handle 7 million passengers a year. The government is also weighing the possibility of leasing Rio de Janeiro\u2019s international airport and other travel hubs expected to see a surge in traffic.\n\u201cToday\u2019s auction was an important first step but still insufficient,\u201d Robson Andrade, head of the National Industry Confederation, said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo . \u201cMore needs to be done to stimulate private sector participation.

Groups led by Sao Paulo-based construction companies Engevix Engenharia SA and TPI - Triunfo Participacoes e Investimentos gained control of airports in Brasilia and Viracopos in Campinas respectively.\nInvestments in Brazil\u2019s aging airports have struggled to keep pace with air travel that has doubled in the past decade as incomes in Latin America \u2019s biggest economy have risen. To help upgrade the airports in time for an expected influx of 500,000 visitors during the monthlong soccer tournament , President Dilma Rousseff \u2019s Workers\u2019 Party abandoned its opposition to private management of facilities it long considered strategic.\n\u201cToday\u2019s auction was an important first step but still insufficient,\u201d Robson Andrade, head of the National Industry Confederation, said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. \u201cMore needs to be done to stimulate private sector participation. There are many airports that require heavy investments.\u201d\nSmall Margins\nShares in Triunfo fell 3.9 percent to 8.45 reais, while losing bidders including highway operator CCR SA rose, as analysts said the total paid for the three licenses -- more than four times the 5.5 billion reais minimum sought by the government -- was too high.\n\u201cThe problem with these airports projects is that profit margins will be low,\u201d Leonardo Nitta, an analyst at Banco do Brasil SA, said by phone from Sao Paulo .\nThe winning operators are expected to invest a total of 16.1 billion reais in the three airports, which together accounted for about a third of Brazil\u2019s 179 million passengers last year and 57 percent of its air cargo. In the case of Guarulhos in Sao Paulo, Latin America\u2019s busiest airport, that includes building a terminal capable of handling 7 million passengers a year. Viracopos and Brasilia will also require new terminals as well as improved runways and parking space.\nBottlenecks\nBrazil\u2019s aviation industry has grown more than any other in the world over the past decade with passenger traffic increasing 118 percent between 2003 and 2011, according to the government. Last year, the world\u2019s fifth-biggest country by land mass trailed only the U.S. and China in volume of domestic air travel, according to data from the Montreal-based Airport Council International. About 12 percent of flights were delayed and one in 20 canceled.\nFaced with pressure to put an end to crowded hallways, flight delays, and busted escalators, Rousseff, a career bureaucrat, created a government agency last year charged with opening airports to private investment. Brazil\u2019s last major privatization drive was in the 1990s, when the government sold off roads and utilities that suffered from decades of underinvestment.\nThe government will maintain a role in the airport modernization drive, through a 49 percent stake in each consortium and via loans to pay improvements from state development bank BNDES.\nThe government \u201ccoming up with that cash is a big concern for investors,\u201d said Eduardo Padilha, a professor specializing in infrastructure finance at the Sao Paulo-based Insper business school. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the big problems of this auction.\u201d\nPension Funds\nInvestimentos e Participacoes em Infra-Estrutura SA , which owns 90 percent of the consortium that will run Guarulhos for 20 years, belongs to employee pension funds from state-run companies including banks Banco do Brasil and Caixa Economica Federal as well as oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA.\nInvepar, as the Rio de Janeiro-based holding company is known, plans to have an initial public offering in the next 12 to 24 months to fund its infrastructure investments, Gustavo Rocha, president of the group told reporters in Sao Paulo following the auction. Johannesburg-based Airports Co. South Africa has a 10 percent share in the consortium.\nViracopos, Brasilia\nTriunfo, together with partners UTC Participacoes SA and Paris-based airport operator Egis Avia , paid 3.8 billion reais for the right to manage Viracopos near Sao Paulo for 30 years.\nEngevix took 25-year control of the airport in the capital, Brasilia, for 4.5 billion reais in a 50/50 venture with Corporacion America, a holding company that runs airports in Argentina . The two companies are building an airport near the northeastern city of Natal after paying 170 million reais last year to win Brazil\u2019s first-ever airport concession auction.\nGustavo do Vale, a former central bank director who heads the Infraero airport authority, repeated today that the government won\u2019t interfere in management of the airports. Rousseff hasn\u2019t decided whether she will auction other travel hubs key to World Cup preparations, such as Rio de Janeiro \u2019s international airport, said Wagner Bittencourt, head of the civil aviation secretariat.\nJerome Valcke , secretary-general of FIFA, has warned that Brazil needs to speed up work on its airports and stadiums.\n\u201cTime is flying and any day you are wasting or losing is a day you are not getting back,\u201d Valcke said during a press conference Jan. 18 in Rio de Janeiro.\nAbout 12 percent of flights were delayed and one in 20 canceled last year, according to Infraero.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jose Sergio Osse in Sao Paulo at josse1@bloomberg.net ; Tais Fuoco in Sao Paulo at tfuoco1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Joshua Goodman at jgoodman19@bloomberg.net\nInvepar Consortium Wins Guarulhos Airport in Auction\nDado Galdieri/Bloomberg\nAirplanes sit parked at Governador Franco Montoro international airport in Guarulhos.\nAirplanes sit parked at Governador Franco Montoro international airport in Guarulhos.

(ITUB4)\nCielo has gained 42 percent this year, compared with a 4.6 percent decline for the 68-company Bovespa index. Redecard, the nation\u2019s No. 2 processor, climbed 9.5 percent on the year to close at 31.95 reais on June 6. Itau offered in February to buy the 49.99 percent of Redecard it doesn\u2019t already own for 11.8 billion reais ($5.8 billion), or 35 reais a share.\nItau, Latin America \u2019s biggest bank by market value, would be able to cut prices at Redecard, pressuring Barueri-based Cielo to do the same and limiting its ability to gain market share, said Carlos Eduardo Daltozo, an analyst at Banco do Brasil SA. Itau could lower the discount rate that determines how much retailers pay for each credit-card transaction if merchants buy other banking products, he said.\n\u201cItau\u2019s offer may change the competitive landscape for card processors and that may be a trigger for people to reduce their positions in Cielo,\u201d Daltozo said in a phone interview. He has a market perform rating on the stock and a price target of 64 reais.\nCielo would face a competitive disadvantage if it becomes Brazil \u2019s only publicly traded payments processor because it would have to disclose strategic financial data that Redecard could keep private as a unit of Itau, according to Flavio Yoshida and Andre Parize, analysts with Votorantim Corretora.\n\u2018Highly Negative\u2019\nThat would be \u201chighly negative to Cielo and the whole industry,\u201d Yoshida and Parize, wrote in a May 15 note to clients. The analysts have a market perform rating on Cielo, with a price target of 60 reais. The shares closed at 56.85 on June 6.\n\u201cAny information about Cielo\u2019s operation will be used by Itau to enhance its acquiring business,\u201d the analysts wrote. Cielo and Redecard, which is also based in Barueri, are known as merchant acquirers. They help businesses accept credit cards and serve as middlemen to the world\u2019s biggest payment networks, including Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA)\nCielo declined to comment, according to its outside public relations company in Sao Paulo.\nOn Feb. 7, less than five years after Redecard went public, Itau announced its plan to pursue full ownership, citing a need to make the payments processor more agile.\nLazard Asset Management LLC, whose 10 percent stake makes it Redecard\u2019s second-biggest investor, criticized the offer and recommended on May 3 that Credit Suisse Group AG be hired to provide a new appraisal of the company, a move that Redecard shareholders approved in a vote two weeks later. Credit Suisse had 30 days from that date to prepare the new appraisal.\nSelling Stake\nItau Chief Executive Officer Roberto Setubal has said he won\u2019t increase the company\u2019s bid even if Credit Suisse says it should be higher, and that Itau may abandon the buyout plan and sell its stake instead. Shares of Redecard have dropped 9.1 percent since Itau threatened to withdraw the offer.\nCielo has expanded in each of the past five quarters, boosting its market share to 60.2 percent without lowering merchant discount rates or fees for point-of-sale equipment. That growth has come at the expense of Redecard, whose market share was 39.8 percent as of March 31, according to an April 25 first-quarter earnings statement from Cielo.\nCielo and Redecard started to face stronger competition after a Brazil central bank ruling in July 2010 ended exclusive rights for the processing of certain transactions.

At 155 percent, 12-month return on equity is almost double Redecard\u2019s 82 percent.\nCielo may continue to gain even if Redecard is delisted because, as the only credit-card company on the Bovespa, the company will attract all of the investors who want to bet on the sector, said Henrique Caldeira, a Barclays Plc analyst in Sao Paulo .\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not time to sell,\u201d said Caldeira, who rates Cielo overweight with a price target of 63 reais a share. \u201cThe company has posted fantastic operating results, and there is no indication that will change anytime soon, whatever the outcome of the Itau offer may be.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Adriana Brasileiro in Rio de Janeiro at abrasileiro@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Steve Dickson at sdickson1@bloomberg.net ; Adriana Arai at aarai1@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:41:49", "post_time": "2012-06-07 23:00:00", "author": "Adriana Brasileiro", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-08/cielo-s-bovespa-star-seen-fading-with-itau-s-redecard-bid.html", "title": "Cielo\u2019s Bovespa Star Seen Fading With Itau\u2019s Redecard Bid", "post_date": "2012-06-07", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "5643a5f6d7bce8b93f3c75e4a0402dd4242e88b4"}, {"content": "Redecard Rebounds as New Appraisal of Itau Offer Is Approved\nBy Denyse Godoy - 2012-05-21T20:56:39Z\nRedecard SA (RDCD3) , Brazil\u2019s second-largest card-payment processor, rebounded from its biggest drop in a year after shareholders voted to get another appraisal of Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) \u2019s 11.8 billion-real ($5.8 billion) bid for the company.\nRedecard advanced 1.8 percent to 30.60 reais at the close of trading in Sao Paulo , reversing an earlier decline of as much as 2.3 percent.

Itau\u2019s press office didn\u2019t return a call seeking comment. Redecard\u2019s press office declined to comment. The Rothschild office in Sao Paulo declined to comment.\nShort Squeeze\nThe increase in borrowed shares may reflect a move by a large investor to create a short squeeze should the stock rise, Luis Gustavo Pereira, a strategist at Futuro Corretora in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone interview today. Traders holding short futures positions get \u201csqueezed\u201d when prices rise rapidly, forcing them to pay a premium to maintain their position or liquidate and cover their contracts.\n\u201cIf the bid goes ahead, Redecard may reach 35 reais,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market is borrowing everything before the event.\u201d\nItau said in an April 30 filing that it has no intention of raising its bid regardless of a second appraisal. The Sao Paulo- based lender also said it may give up its buyout plans if the transaction can\u2019t be completed in a timely manner.\n\u201cIf the bid fails, Itau may seek to renegotiate the prices of some services it provides Redecard,\u201d said Ribeiro, who estimates the shares are worth 39 reais each and recommends investors buy the stock. \u201cItau would probably impose new fees on Redecard, and the market may punish the shares.\u201d\nNovo Mercado\nItau had also warned that it may delist Redecard from Bovespa\u2019s Novo Mercado if shareholders didn\u2019t accept the 35 reais bid. Itau said April 16 it would no longer pursue that course of action after Brazil\u2019s minority-shareholders association said such a move would require approval by two- thirds of holders.\nTwo-thirds of Redecard\u2019s shareholders also must approve Itau\u2019s bid for it to go through. No date has been set for a vote.\nRedecard and its shareholders raised 4.07 billion reais in its initial public offering in July 2007, Brazil \u2019s biggest share sale in five years at that time.

The Bovespa index rose 2 percent.\nBrazil\u2019s power regulator Aneel cut the amount Eletropaulo charges customers by 9.3 percent as President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s government seeks to stem inflation and boost growth. The decrease means Eletropaulo probably won\u2019t be able to pay dividends, said Ricardo Correa, an analyst at Rio de Janeiro- based brokerage Ativa SA.\n\u201cThe cut is big and because it was delayed, the entire earnings of this past year will be impacted,\u201d Correa said today by telephone. \u201cThat means there will be rather small cash generation this year.\u201d\nA regulatory audit had recommended an 8.8 percent reduction.

The average inflation-adjusted impact for consumers will be a 2.3 percent decline, Aneel said in a separate announcement today.\nDividend Yield\nThe ruling prompted Banco Santander SA (SAN) to trim Eletropaulo\u2019s 12-month share price estimate to 20.55 reais from 36.30 reais.\nSantander forecast a 60 percent decline in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization over the next year and kept its rating at underperform amid prospects that dividends will \u201calmost disappear,\u201d analysts Marcio Prado, Danilo Vitti and Carolina Carneiro, said in a client note today.\n\u201cEletropaulo\u2019s fundamentals have deteriorated significantly with the confirmation of a tough tariff revision,\u201d the Santander analysts wrote.\nThe stock has lost 37 percent this year compared with the Bovespa\u2019s 1.5 percent decline.\nEletropaulo, based in Sao Paulo , has the highest dividend yield among Brazilian companies worth $500 million or more, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Mario Sergio Lima in Brasilia Newsroom at mlima11@bloomberg.net ; Rodrigo Orihuela in Rio de Janeiro at rorihuela@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:42:04", "post_time": "2012-07-03 17:56:20", "author": "Mario Sergio Lima , Rodrigo Orihuela", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-03/aes-brazil-unit-eletropaulo-s-tariffs-reduced-9-by-regulator.html", "title": "Eletropaulo Falls Most in Bovespa on Electricity Rate Cut", "post_date": "2012-07-03", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "1c806c5f36bdd185caca7897ec412fb6b263f067"}, {"content": "Eletropaulo Dividends Imperiled in Brazilian Rate Review\nBy Rodrigo Orihuela and Mario Sergio Lima - 2012-06-05T03:00:01Z\nEletropaulo Metropolitana Eletricidade de Sao Paulo SA \u2019s tariff talks with the government this month will show whether Brazil will sacrifice the country\u2019s highest dividend payouts to help contain inflation.\nEletropaulo, as the AES Corp. unit is known, is locked in negotiations with regulator Aneel over prices Brazil\u2019s biggest distributor can bill in the next four years. Authorities proposed an 8.8 percent reduction to benefit customers.\nPresident Dilma Rousseff is pushing utilities from Eletropaulo to Cia. Energetica de Minas Gerais , the nation\u2019s most profitable non-financial industry, to cut tariffs after inflation exceeded the central bank\u2019s 4.5 percent target every month since August 2010. Too big a price cut would erode investor returns and push up funding costs, said Eletropaulo Chief Executive Officer Britaldo Soares.\n\u201cThe importance of the process is to maintain the balance of companies\u2019 investment capacity, vis-a-vis Brazil \u2019s modernization challenges, better tariffs for customers and appropriate returns for investors to keep the sector bankable,\u201d Soares said in a May 22 interview in Rio de Janeiro.\nEletropaulo, based in Sao Paulo , has a dividend yield of 28.5 percent, the highest among Brazilian companies with a market value of at least $500 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Electricity companies account for eight of the 20 highest dividend yields.\n\u2018Balanced\u2019 to Clients\nBrazilian utilities have an average operating profit margin of 15.4 percent, the highest among nine non-financial industries tracked by Bloomberg. The second highest is consumer goods at 15 percent.\nEletropaulo\u2019s share price has slumped 34 percent so far this year compared with a 5.9 percent slide by Brazil\u2019s benchmark index and a 2.1 percent decline by Santiago-based Enersis SA, the Latin American unit of Spain \u2019s Endesa SA.\nOver the past five years Eletropaulo\u2019s share price slid 24 percent, while its total return jumped 83 percent.\nThe industry\u2019s profitability and dividend levels signal prices need to be \u201cbalanced\u201d more toward customers, said Nelson Hubner, general director of Aneel.\n\u201cIf companies turned a profit in one tariff cycle, it\u2019s a sign that I can capture a lot of that in the next cycle,\u201d Hubner said in a May 29 interview in Brasilia. \u201cWe are going to start to do that. The consumer will profit with that.\u201d\nStrict Rules\nEletropaulo\u2019s communications department didn\u2019t respond to telephone and e-mailed requests for comment on whether Aneel\u2019s proposed tariff changes would prompt a reduction in dividends.\nCia. Paranaense de Energia , the largest distributor in Brazil\u2019s southern region, is also in talks with Aneel over tariffs to be put in place June 24. The regulator proposed a 0.85 percent reduction for the Curitiba-based company known as Copel.\nThe larger cut proposed for Eletropaulo is related to company investments that the regulator decided to exclude from the tariff framework, according to Antonio Junqueira, an analyst at Banco BTG Pactual SA.\n\u201cThe government is being strict within the rules, which is their job,\u201d Junqueira said by telephone from Rio de Janeiro . \u201cThe process took place in the right manner.\u201d\nWhile Eletropaulo\u2019s last tariff cycle, in 2007, led to a bigger cut than the 8.8 percent proposed in this month\u2019s review, other terms in the previous package, such as prices paid to generators, offset the earnings impact, Junqueira said.\nInflation Link\nAneel, which delayed this month\u2019s Eletropaulo revision from July last year, is also considering scrapping a mechanism that links rate adjustments with inflation. That could hurt distributors more than generators and transmission companies whose operating margins are wider, according to BTG\u2019s Junqueira.\nLower tariffs would help contain inflation, giving Rousseff more scope to stimulate the economy. Brazil\u2019s central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to a record 8.5 percent last month, taking total reductions since August to four percentage points. The economy expanded a lower-than-forecast 0.2 percent in the first quarter from the three previous months.\nAuthorities must understand that high dividends and quality service aren\u2019t \u201cincompatible,\u201d said Luiz Fernando Rolla, chief financial officer of Cemig, Brazil\u2019s largest power company by market value.\n\u201cDistribution is an investment business,\u201d Rolla said in a May 22 interview in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cIn order to invest you need to attract investors and the only way to do that is to have a very clear, solid and transparent dividend policy.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Rodrigo Orihuela in Rio de Janeiro at rorihuela@bloomberg.net Mario Sergio Lima in Brasilia Newsroom at mlima11@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Dale Crofts at dcrofts@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:42:08", "post_time": "2012-06-04 23:00:01", "author": "Rodrigo Orihuela , Mario Sergio Lima", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-05/eletropaulo-dividends-imperiled-in-brazilian-rate-review.html", "title": "Eletropaulo Dividends Imperiled in Brazilian Rate Review", "post_date": "2012-06-04", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "cc95062c2f67fa9354c83c45148c551ce3bbcb26"}, {"content": "Eletrobras Leads Drop in Brazil Utilities on Power Rates Concern\nBy Denyse Godoy - 2012-05-21T21:59:23Z\nCentrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) fell to the lowest in seven years, leading a plunge in Brazilian utilities, amid concern the government will seek to lower electricity rates.\nVoting shares of Eletrobras, as the largest Brazilian utility is known, fell 4.7 percent to 18.45 reais at the close in Sao Paulo , the worst performer on the benchmark Bovespa index, which rose 3.8 percent.

The project is owned by CPFL Renovaveis, part of Brazil\u2019s largest private utility CPFL Group, according to the statement.\n\u201cThe contract with CPFL Renovaveis opens up a new market of clear commercial interest to Acciona Windpower,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Pedro Ruiz said. \u201cWe are entering Brazil with a strong customer that\u2019s one of the country\u2019s leading wind power operators.\u201d\nThe company, which builds turbines at three factories in Spain and the U.S., plans to add a manufacturing plant in Brazil. Latin America\u2019s biggest economy may install as much as 2,000 megawatts of wind generators in 2012, making it the fourth-largest market compared with 11th last year, according to the Global Wind Energy Council.\nAcciona, Spain\u2019s second-biggest wind farm operator, is based in Madrid.

A successful pricing may show the way for a pipeline of 40 proposed initial offerings that the Sao Paulo stock exchange estimates at $28 billion, and could offer a template for reducing the government\u2019s role as a top provider of loans to private businesses.\n\u201cEsteves doesn\u2019t want to be just an aggressive and young investment banker anymore,\u201d said Ricardo Rocha, a finance professor at the Insper business school in Sao Paulo . \u201cHe wants to be a lead actor in the Brazilian economy. He wants to expand in Brazil and Latin America in a world in which there is a lack of capital for the big international banks.\u201d\nThe state has a hand in much of the lending that takes place in Brazil, the world\u2019s second-largest developing economy after China. Credit extended by banks majority-owned by the government grew to 44 percent of the market in January, from 42 percent a year earlier and 34 percent in August 2008, according to central bank data.\nBanco Panamericano\nThose figures don\u2019t reflect the government\u2019s full reach, because they exclude lenders such as Banco Votorantim SA and Banco Panamericano SA, in which the state owns 49.99 percent of the voting shares.\nBrazil also owns some of the country\u2019s biggest firms, including Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the largest company by market value on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, and Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) , Latin America\u2019s biggest utility.\nThe government-controlled development bank , known as BNDES, helps finance many of the nation\u2019s largest takeovers. JBS SA, the world\u2019s No. 1 beef producer, sold 3.48 billion reais ($1.9 billion) in convertible bonds to BNDES in 2009 to fund the acquisition of Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp. and Bertin SA. From 2000 to 2010, BNDES loaned 11 billion reais to Oi SA and Telemar Participacoes SA and injected an additional 2.6 billion in capital for a restructuring in 2008. Luciano Coutinho , president of BNDES, said at the time that the state\u2019s help was justified to create a company with the scale to compete globally.\nA Ministry of Finance official declined to comment on the government\u2019s role in the economy, as did a BNDES official.\nRothschild Family\nBTG is owned by Esteves, his executive partners and a group of investors that includes the Rothschild family and Italy \u2019s Agnelli family, which controls automaker Fiat SpA.\nThe firm will \u201copen the door for other companies to access the capital markets ,\u201d said Banco Pactual SA founder Luiz Cezar Fernandes, who is now CEO of Laep Investments Ltd. He said Brazil \u201cneeds a strong equity market\u201d to keep growing.\nFernandes, 66, created Pactual in 1983. He says it was meant to be a copy of New York-based Goldman (GS) Sachs Group Inc. \u201cwith a tropical flavor.\u201d In fact, Esteves sometimes jokes that BTG now stands for \u201cBetter than Goldman.\u201d\nOfficially, the acronym stands for Banking and Trading Group.\n\u2018Sadness\u2019 Over\nFernandes hired Esteves in 1989 as a systems analyst and became his mentor in the investment-banking business, only to be outmaneuvered by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in 1998. That\u2019s when Esteves demanded Fernandes sell him his stake in the bank in exchange for loans Fernandes needed for other business interests. Fernandes, who afterward said Esteves would \u201csell his own mother to obtain power,\u201d said earlier this month in an interview that the \u201csadness\u201d of those days is over, and he\u2019s happy BTG is successful enough to go public.\nGoldman Sachs tried to buy Esteves\u2019s company before he sold it to Zurich-based UBS AG in 2006 for $3.5 billion, making himself a billionaire in the process. As a UBS executive, he tried to buy the entire Swiss bank in 2007, without success. He repurchased Pactual in 2009 for $2.5 billion.\nThe bank has been a \u201cgrowth engine\u201d ever since, said Ceres Lisboa, a banking analyst at Moody\u2019s Corp. Total capital has grown to $4.75 billion from $2 billion during the period, and assets under management jumped to almost $100 billion from $30 billion, according to the company.\nStill, Lisboa said most revenue comes from proprietary trading, which is subject to wide swings from quarter to quarter. Gross revenue from that business jumped to 4.6 billion reais in 2011, 70 percent more than in 2010, she said.\n\u2018Volatile\u2019 Revenue\n\u201cThey have a very active and aggressive proprietary trading area, but it is a volatile source of revenue and increases the bank\u2019s risk,\u201d Lisboa said.\nOfficials at BTG declined to comment, citing the \u201cquiet period\u201d before the planned IPO.\nService fees from asset management and wealth management , a more stable revenue source, rose to 511.5 million reais in 2011 from 343.4 million reais in 2010. Total service fees, which include broker dealer and investment-banking revenue, climbed to 1.087 billion reais in 2011 from 798.8 million reais a year earlier.\nBTG\u2019s earnings were 1.9 billion reais last year, a 19 percent increase from 2010. Return on average equity fell to 24.4 percent from 27.5 percent, still the highest among the top Brazilian banks and, in keeping with the BTG acronym, better than Goldman, which posted a 3.7 percent return on equity for 2011.\nM&A Advice\nBTG was the No. 1 adviser on mergers and acquisitions in Brazil for 2011 and the second-biggest equity underwriter, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The company was the second-largest in Brazil for fixed-income distribution, up from sixth in 2009, according to Anbima, the local investment-bank and capital- markets association. BTG is sixth in asset management, behind the largest retail banks.\nIn June, BTG announced its first private-equity fund, with $1.6 billion in total. Partners and employees invested $200 million, while $500 million came from Banco BTG capital, said Carlos Fonseca, head of BTG\u2019s merchant-banking unit. About 15 percent of the bank\u2019s capital is invested in private equity. Esteves said in February he plans to create an investment fund of at least 3 billion reais to tap into infrastructure development in Brazil.\nSister Companies\nThe IPO will give investors stakes in both Banco BTG and BTG Participations Ltd., the company that owns BTG\u2019s private- equity business. The two sister companies have spent more than $2.8 billion since the beginning of 2009 on about 17 acquisitions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nBTG\u2019s investments include Brasbunker Participacoes SA, an off-shore transportation and oil-and-gas-services company, and Brazil Pharma SA (BPHA3) , the nation\u2019s biggest pharmacy chain by number of stores.\nBTG also invests in real estate, buying control of WTorre Properties SA in 2001 and merging it with BR Properties SA in September. Esteves\u2019s bank owns a 77.4 percent stake in Estapar, Brazil\u2019s largest parking-lot administrator, and a stake in ERSA- Energia Renovaveis SA, one of the owners of CPFL Energias Renovaveis SA, the biggest producer of renewable energy in Brazil.\nPanamericano Deal\nBTG helped the government in February 2011 when it agreed to pay 450 million reais for 50.01 percent of the voting shares of Panamericano, the Sao Paulo-based bank bailed out in 2010 after suspected accounting fraud. Panamericano gave Esteves a partnership with Caixa Economica Federal, the government-owned bank that\u2019s Brazil\u2019s biggest mortgage lender.\nBTG is also a government partner on Sete Brasil Participacoes SA, an oil-rig provider owned by Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , banks and pension funds.\nIn December, Panamericano and BTG announced the purchase of Brazilian Finance & Real Estate SA, the country\u2019s top issuer of real estate-backed securities, for about 1.2 billion reais.\nBTG said last month it agreed to buy Chilean brokerage Celfin Capital SA for $245 million in cash and 2.4 percent of BTG equity. The equity portion totaled about $355 million, according to a person familiar with the matter, meaning BTG was worth about $15 billion.\nEsteves\u2019s Stake\nEsteves and his partners won\u2019t sell shares in the IPO, and some plan to purchase new ones to avoid diluting their stakes, according to a person familiar with the deal who asked not to be named because the matter is private.\nOther stakeholders in the company, like J.C. Flowers & Co., Government of Singapore Investment Corp., China Investment Corp. and the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, may sell their stakes.\nEsteves hasn\u2019t yet said how many shares will be sold in the IPO or when the bank will offer them. Proceeds will be used to \u201ccontinue expanding its businesses\u201d and to improve its \u201cfunding structure,\u201d the company said in a filing earlier this month. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Banco Bradesco SA will coordinate the equity offering.\n\u201cBTG isn\u2019t simply collecting fees or trading derivatives; it\u2019s also putting capital to work in productive businesses,\u201d Fernandes, the company\u2019s founder, said. \u201cWhat Esteves is trying to sell in the IPO is not only a bank but also Brazil.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Cristiane Lucchesi in Sao Paulo at clucchesi5@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Scheer at dscheer@bloomberg.net\nBanco BTG Pactual SA CEO Andre Esteves\nJin Lee/Bloomberg\nAndre Esteves, chief executive officer of Banco BTG Pactual SA, speaks at the Foreign Policy Association's annual Financial Services Dinner in New York on Feb. 23, 2011.\nAndre Esteves, chief executive officer of Banco BTG Pactual SA, speaks at the Foreign Policy Association's annual Financial Services Dinner in New York on Feb. 23, 2011.

The German steelmaker may choose a shortlist of two or three bidders in November, they said.\nSome of the larger international steelmakers such as ArcelorMittal and Posco may look at both the Alabama and Rio de Janeiro state plants, while the U.S. players are interested in the American site and the South American companies in the Brazilian plant, said the people. The plants may fetch $3 billion to $5 billion, they said.\nThat\u2019s less than the book value of at least $9 billion that Heinrich Hiesinger, ThyssenKrupp\u2019s chief executive officer, said in August he wants to sell the unit for.\nErin DiPietro, a spokeswoman for U.S. Steel, said the company doesn\u2019t comment on speculation, as did Giles Read, a spokesman for ArcelorMittal. (MT) Officials in CSN\u2019s press office declined to comment. Officials at Ternium didn\u2019t immediately respond to calls and e-mails seeking comment. Officials at Nucor couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment, while those at Posco, JFE and Nippon Steel couldn\u2019t be reached by calls outside of normal business hours.\nStrategic Options\nThyssenKrupp announced in May that a sale of its U.S. and Brazilian plants is among \u201cstrategic options\u201d as it grapples with the rising costs of building plants in Brazil and the U.S. as the projects suffer delays. The Essen-based company was already divesting assets contributing about a quarter of annual revenue before that decision, including its stainless-steel business, as it seeks to reduce debt and fund growth.\nThyssenKrupp started operating its Brazilian plant in 2010, two years later than originally planned, to provide steel slabs to its mills in Alabama and Germany. The two American plants, on which ThyssenKrupp has spent more than 10 billion euros ($13 billion), according to Hiesinger, were meant to work as an integrated network.\nDelays at the Brazilian plant, 73.1 percent-held by ThyssenKrupp and the rest by Vale SA (VALE3) , contributed to impairment charges of 2.9 billion euros in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2011, for which the company reported a loss. The Steel America\u2019s adjusted loss before interest and taxes accumulated to 778 million euros in the first nine months of the following fiscal year as production costs were higher than originally expected and steel prices increased less than expected.\nThyssenKrupp declined to comment on the number or names of bidders. Kilian Roetzer, a company spokesman, pointed to a statement published on Sept. 28 saying: \u201cInterest in both plants remains very high and has been reinforced by on-site inspections.\u201d\nGerman newspaper Die Welt on Oct. 10 reported that at  least five bidders had submitted offers.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Aaron Kirchfeld in London at akirchfeld@bloomberg.net ; Tino Andresen in Dusseldorf at tandresen1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jacqueline Simmons at jackiem@bloomberg.net ; John Viljoen at jviljoen@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:42:42", "post_time": "2012-10-11 14:31:15", "author": "Aaron Kirchfeld , Tino Andresen", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-11/thyssenkrupp-s-u-s-and-brazilian-plants-said-to-draw-eight-bids.html", "title": "ThyssenKrupp\u2019s U.S. and Brazilian Plants Said to Draw Eight Bids", "post_date": "2012-10-11", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "16db18c93576ebf1fbcd9a4f4139ca3ac1d8e35d"}, {"content": "ThyssenKrupp Gains on Posco Americas LOI Report: Frankfurt Mover\nBy Tino Andresen - 2012-10-04T12:15:46Z\nThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) climbed in Frankfurt trading on a report that Posco (005490) of South Korea submitted a letter of intent to buy its Steel Americas unit, bolstering speculation that bidding competition may boost the price of the asset.\nGermany \u2019s biggest steelmaker rose as much as 3.7 percent to 17.63 euros, its highest level since Sept. 17.

The measures include revised conditions for the renewal of licenses due from 2015 to 2017.\n\u201cWe are giving them an option, while reinvigorating their business for 30 more years,\u201d the minister said during an interview yesterday in Brasilia. \u201cBut we\u2019re not imposing anything. Those who are not satisfied can comply with the current law and return the asset to the federal government.\u201d\nExpiring concessions are mostly part of the state-run power utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) , or Eletrobras, and won\u2019t affect the private initiative, according to Lobao.\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t understand all the crying,\u201d Lobao said. \u201cWe are not taking anything from anyone.\u201d\nThe government will compensate companies that haven\u2019t paid off required investments under existing licenses. The 21 billion reais ($10.4 billion) set aside for such a purpose is more than enough, the minister said.\nCia. Energetica de Minas Gerais , Brazil\u2019s largest power company by market value, declined 20 percent to close at 25.29 reais in Sao Paulo on Sept. 12 after earlier falling as much as 23 percent, the biggest intraday drop since September 1998.

(ELET6)\n\u201cThe time has come to give back to society the benefits for paying for investments through a lower, just and balanced tariff,\u201d Rousseff told executives from the energy industry at an event in Brasilia. \u201cCheaper energy means lower production cost and more resources for investments.\u201d\nAs growth in Latin America \u2019s biggest economy has flagged, Rousseff\u2019s administration has been shifting its focus from stimulating consumer demand to attacking the high costs of business that have long deterred investment. Today\u2019s energy reduction plan is part of a \u201cnew phase\u201d of Brazil\u2019s development that also include payroll tax cuts for select industries and the auctioning of licenses to manage roads, railways, ports and airports, Rousseff said.\nLower utility rates will also help Rousseff tame inflation , which has remained above the government\u2019s 4.5 percent target since September 2010. Finance Minister Guido Mantega said today that the cut in electricity costs for households and businesses will shave between 0.5 and 1 percentage point off inflation starting next year.\nUtilities Fall\nPower generators and distributors fell as investors bet that the license renewal terms offered by regulators will be unfavorable.\nCia. Energetica de Minas Gerais , Brazil\u2019s largest utility by market value, fell 1.5 percent to 34.57 reais at 12:11 p.m. in Sao Paulo. State-run power generator and distributor Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, better known as Eletrobras, fell 1.2 percent and Cia.

Marcio Loureiro, senior equity analyst at Votorantim Ctvm Ltda, said the measures weren\u2019t as severe as the energy sector had expected.\nAffect Results\n\u201cCompany results could fall a bit, but nothing that is outside their investment plans,\u201d he said by telephone from Sao Paulo.\nEnergy Minister Edison Lobao said companies that haven\u2019t paid off required investments under existing licenses will be compensated.\nRousseff, in a nationally televised address to commemorate Brazil\u2019s Independence Day last week, outlined her goal of reducing power rates by 16 percent for households and as much as 28 percent for larger consumers and manufacturers. Today, she said that the cost reductions, which will come about through tax breaks, could be even larger after regulators conclude a study of the industry\u2019s performance.\nContracts affecting about 20 percent of Brazil \u2019s energy generation and that are set to expire by 2017 will be renewed under the plan, she said. Companies that don\u2019t accept the new terms offered by the government will have their concessions re- auctioned.\nBoosting Competitiveness\nThe main goal is to heighten the competitiveness of Brazilian manufacturers, who have lost market share to cheaper imports as a result of currency gains and rising labor costs in recent years, and more recently from weaker domestic and international demand. While industrial production expanded 0.3 percent in July, it\u2019s still down 3.7 percent this year.\nThe cut on taxes charged consumers and the plans to maintain public investments in the industry will cost the government 3.3 billion reais a year, Treasury Secretary Arno Augustin said.\nToday\u2019s announcement \u201cshows that industry requests had echo in the government,\u201d Franklin Feder, Chief Executive Officer for Alcoa Inc. in Latin America, told reporters at today\u2019s event.\nBrazil\u2019s industry pays an average of 330 reais ($162) per megawatt-hour, the fourth-highest rate in the world, according to the National Industry Confederation.\nBenjamin Steinbruch, president of Sao Paulo-based steelmaker Cia. Siderurgica Nacional (CSNA3) , said on Aug. 15 that a 10 to 20 percent reduction of electricity rates would be insufficient compared to much lower rates in the U.S. and China .\n\u201cBrazil is an expensive country,\u201d he said Aug. 15.\nFeder told reporters that with the rate cuts announced today Brazil\u2019s production costs will be moving closer to the world average.

A month after their encounter on Sept. 12, Enders, the chief executive officer of European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. (EAD) , saw his aspiration to combine with BAE Systems Plc (BA/) crumble amid German opposition. Hintze said the breakdown was in Germany\u2019s best interest.\nBy publicly blaming the German government for the collapse of the negotiations, Enders risks further straining relations as he draws up an alternative plan to boost EADS\u2019s defense business. The German military is the biggest customer of that unit and the two sides also need to agree on cuts to Tiger and NH90 helicopter purchases, built by EADS unit Eurocopter, with more than $5 billion on the line.\n\u201cEnders will arguably not see the German government as a naturally constructive partner for the further development of EADS,\u201d said Henrik Heidenkamp, a German defense industry analyst at the Royal United Services Institute in London .\nGerman lawmakers pushed back on Enders\u2019s assessment that their government was to blame. Enders had written in a letter to employees that he underestimated opposition from Berlin. Merkel ultimately buried the merger in a phone call to French President Francois Hollande in which she voiced her veto, people familiar with the conversation said.\nMerkel\u2019s Call\n\u201cMost of my colleagues weren\u2019t against it, it\u2019s just that it wasn\u2019t well prepared,\u201d said Martin Lindner, economic spokesman for the Free Democratic Party, Merkel\u2019s coalition partner. \u201cI understand that Tom Enders and his crew are not keen on involving politicians in a merger, even when he\u2019s the CEO of a very political company. Many of the products they make have governments as their clients.\u201d\nOptimism about winning more time and getting all governments on board evaporated on the morning of Oct. 9, a day before a deadline to file a merger document, one person said. That morning, Hollande took a phone call from Merkel, informing him that she opposed the deal, the person said. Hollande, who favored the combination, didn\u2019t want to overrule the German chancellor, the person said.\n\u201cWe were informed by the German chancellery that the chancellor had called the deal off,\u201d said Rainer Ohler , a spokesman for EADS. \u201cWe offered dialog on a constant basis, conversations and negotiations, none of which was taken up.\u201d\nDefense Review\nThe EADS CEO encountered a frosty reception from lawmakers when he presented the deal to a parliamentary hearing. After the session ended, Enders said he\u2019d gladly go on discussing the merits of the merger with lawmakers. Merkel\u2019s spokesman said the chancellor saw no need to meet Enders in Berlin.\nNow Enders will need to rebuild political support for his efforts to revamp the faltering Cassidian defense business, largely centered in Germany. Before merger talks with BAE surfaced Enders, as one of his first actions as CEO, ousted the unit\u2019s long-time head and put in place a new management team.\nEnders told staff he would review group strategy \u201cand defense activities in particular\u201d after the talks ended. Cassidian had about 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) in sales last year, or 11 percent of EADS\u2019s total. The Airbus SAS civil aircraft unit, which Enders led until June, is the biggest.\nEADS is working toward an agreement with Germany over how many Tigers and NH90s the armed forces will buy before year-end. German said it may halve the Tiger purchase to 40 attack helicopters and cut 42 units from a planned buy of 122 NH90 troop transport rotorcraft.\nMinisterial Snub\nWhile Germany said it supports EADS management \u201can acid test of that will come with the restructuring of Cassidian,\u201d said Olivier Brochet, Paris-based analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.\n\u201cThe need to reshuffle that activity, which lacks critical size, has grown with the calling off of the BAE consolidation,\u201d he said. \u201cEnders\u2019s ability to slash costs to restore its competitiveness will indicate the level of control he still has over the group.\u201d\nContractual negotiations have been a source of friction between Enders and the German government in the past. In 2010, months-long negotiations over the A400M military airlifter so alienated then-German Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg that he publicly snubbed the aircraft\u2019s German maiden flight at the Berlin Air Show.\nTensions between the government and Enders over additional financing escalated to the point that EADS Finance Chief Hans Peter Ring, who was a popular figure with lawmakers and based in Munich, took over negotiations on the German side, and the government also replacing Guttenberg as its interlocutor.\nAway From Munich\nDiscontent also flared on the civil aviation side. In the early development phase of Airbus\u2019s A350 wide-body plane, France got 40 percent of the work-share compared with just 30 percent for Germany, breaking a quarter century tradition of allotting work in proportion to countries\u2019 shareholders in the planemaker.\nEnders argued that France boasted deeper engineering resources, and that it was Germany\u2019s fault for not promoting aerospace more. Germany threatened to withhold development loans. The tone got shriller when Enders consolidated EADS headquarters in Toulouse, France, this year. The company had previously operated a dual-structure with Munich and Paris as co-equal centers of power. Hintze wrote Enders a letter complaining that the shift from Germany was unacceptable.\n\u201cYou have to knuckle down to business as usual,\u201d said Sandy Morris , London-based analyst at Jefferies International. \u201cIf commercial negotiations become embroiled in politics, heaven help us.\u201d\nOne area the government and EADS may need to pool resources is to assure support in the effort to catch the U.S. and Israel in the growing field of unmanned aircraft. The U.K. and France have awarded contracts for BAE and Dassault Aviation SA (AM) to jointly work on future unmanned combat aircraft, leaving EADS in the cold.\nShareholder Squabbles\nHintze made support of German unmanned aircraft technology a centerpiece of an aerospace policy document three years ago. At the time, the German-arm of EADS was pushing the Talarion unmanned aircraft program, but it failed to get backing in other European states. EADS abandoned the project this year.\nA major driving force behind Enders\u2019s push for a merger with BAE had been his wish to throw out a shareholder agreement that gave governments more sway over his company than he wanted. In the end, his quest to marginalize governments had the opposite reaction, with Germany demanding an equal stake to France and a center of command, contributing to the negotiations unraveling.\nAs to who perseveres in the Teutonic battle between Enders and Hintze \u201ca lot depends on the German public debate over the next days and weeks,\u201d Heidenkamp said.\n\u201cIf the reasoning is that this decision was wrong and short-sighted then Hintze may find himself under significant pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no obvious alternative to Tom Enders , at least in the short term. Therefore, his position, although weakened, is arguably stronger than Hintze\u2019s.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Robert Wall in London at rwall6@bloomberg.net ; Andrea Rothman in Toulouse at aerothman@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Benedikt Kammel at bkammel@bloomberg.net\nGerman Federal Ministry of Economics Deputy Minister Peter Hintz\nAntoine Antoniol/Bloomberg\nPeter Hintze, German Federal Ministry of Economics deputy minister.\nPeter Hintze, German Federal Ministry of Economics deputy minister.

Chief Executive Tom Enders , who beat his counterpart at Boeing Co. (BA) three years ago in a horse race in Wyoming , now has his eyes on a bigger prize: supremacy in global aerospace.\nThe 53-year-old German former paratrooper is seeking to combine EADS with British defense company BAE Systems Plc (BA/) to marry the largest maker of civil aircraft with Europe \u2019s biggest defense contractor. EADS would own 60 percent and BAE the rest of a group that would topple Boeing from its pinnacle.\nFull Special Report: Berlin Airshow\nMelding civil aviation and defense would let Enders fulfill a 15-year-old aspiration to consolidate the European aerospace industry and loosen the shackles of political interference. Enders, who plotted the merger even before becoming CEO in June, must appease governments and sell the merger to investors who drove EADS down 10 percent yesterday.\n\u201cPeople have been trying for decades to create a unified European aerospace powerhouse,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia , vice president of Teal Group, a Fairfax, Virginia-based aviation forecaster. \u201cIf he pulls this off, he earns a place in history and may finally sidestep the issue of national control.\u201d\nSince its creation in 2000 from the aerospace assets of France, Germany and Spain , EADS has been the subject of government meddling, pitting French against German executives in battles for control of the company and its assets. Passports trumped industrial logic.\nReluctant Shareholders\nIt also saddled EADS with reluctant shareholders in the form of German carmaker Daimler AG (DAI) and French media conglomerate Lagardere SCA (MMB) , whose CEO, Arnauld Lagardere, made headlines posing with his supermodel girlfriend in a video shoot. Some 50 percent of company shares are tied up with the core shareholders with veto power over major decisions.\nEnders has been an outspoken critic of the shareholder structure, saying a plan by Daimler to move shares under German government control is a \u201cstep in the wrong direction.\u201d The proposed BAE merger would dissolve the agreement, freeing the shareholders and creating a company with a true free float.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a tough customer for most politicians, knows what he wants and isn\u2019t afraid to ruffle feathers,\u201d said Michael Fuchs , the economic-policy spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2019s party. \u201cThis is a tremendous coup for Enders who has just broken the mold of political influence at the company that was such a thorn in his side.\u201d\nU.S. Springboard\nCombining with BAE would hand Enders a powerful springboard into the U.S. market, the world\u2019s largest for military sales, where EADS now ranks as the 100th largest supplier to the Pentagon. By contrast, BAE is No. 4 and generates 50 percent of sales in North America .\nEnders, a pilot who knows how to shear sheep after growing up as the son of a shepherd, has endured setbacks in his quest to win U.S. business. Airbus won a $35 billion contract in 2008 to provide refueling tankers to the U.S. Air Force, in a major upset for Boeing, which later managed to successfully challenge the victory and win a rematch.\nOn the civil aviation side, Enders has fared better in the U.S. Airbus won a contract to supply single-aisle jets to American Airlines last year, prying an exclusive Boeing customer from its arch-rival\u2019s hands. In June, Airbus announced plans for an assembly line in Alabama for single-aisle jets, advancing Enders\u2019s quest to derive more business from the U.S.\nFueling Change\nThe rapprochement with BAE comes just three months into Enders\u2019s tenure as EADS CEO. Enders made clear from the get-go that he would shake up EADS, telling employees in a memo that he\u2019d travel the company to \u201cfuel changes in strategy, structure and organization.\u201d\nEven before Enders took the top job, EADS and BAE were plotting a combination, seeking to overcome two decades of frustrated ambition to create a European champion. Preliminary talks took place in April, and by early June the two had engaged in more serious discussions about a merger, people with knowledge of the negotiations said.\nEnders\u2019s career in the industry spans more than two decades, rising through the ranks of Germany\u2019s Deutsche Aerospace to become head of strategy under CEO Juergen Schrempp, the former Daimler CEO and Enders\u2019s mentor.\nIn 1998, Schrempp sought to merge his company with BAE- forerunner British Aerospace. While the two were already partners within Airbus and on the Eurofighter combat jet, British Aerospace ditched Dasa and eloped with Britain\u2019s GEC Marconi, driving the Germans into the arms of the French.\nSuperjumbo Woes\nThe Anglo-German split in the European industry along civil and defense lines became final in 2006, when BAE sold its 20 percent stake in Airbus back to EADS. BAE used the proceeds to beef up operations in the U.S., while EADS battled cost overruns on its A380 superjumbo and management upheavals.\nAttempting another marriage half a decade later underscores Enders\u2019s willingness to seize a chance, said John Leahy , the Airbus sales chief who has been instrumental in the manufacturer\u2019s rise to the top.\n\u201cTom is very focused but not afraid to move quickly when he sees an opportunity,\u201d said Leahy, who was elevated to the executive board of EADS by Enders last week.\nOne thing Enders is famous for besides his drive is his temper. Disapproval of Germany\u2019s abstention from the Libyan liberation campaign last year led him to quit Angela Merkel\u2019s political party in a public split. Enders rattled politicians on the other side of the negotiation table with his take-no- prisoners demand for more funding on the A400M troop transporter, eventually getting his way.\nGuns, Knives\nMuch of his energy is poured into sports. At past Wyoming gatherings, Enders has distinguished himself at knife-throwing contests and horse races that left Boeing CEO Jim McNerney in the dust, according to people who attended the private events.\nEnders\u2019s sporting prowess has on occasion left him worse for wear. At this week\u2019s Berlin Air show, Enders had to greet German Chancellor Angela Merkel with his arm in a sling following a hang-glider accident. The incident also forced him to scrap a trip to meet Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao .\nWhen not in business attire, Enders comes across as a hands-on aviator, sporting leather flight jackets and shades. Behind the macho persona is a pragmatist and thoughtful listener, according to Gerard Blanc, a former head of operations and programs at Airbus. Blanc said Enders, a defense expert, accepted an invitation to hear his views on commercial aerospace even after Blanc had left the organization.\n\u201cHe was really listening, not just pretending,\u201d Blanc said. \u201cI think this very much helped him build a career within EADS.\u201d\nEnders had briefly held the EADS CEO title before, when he shared the role with a French counterpart. He stepped down in 2007 to lead Airbus, as part of a wider shakeup aimed to defuse Franco-German tensions over the distribution of power.\n\u201cMany people would see that as demotion, but he had a long-term plan,\u201d said Zafar Khan, a London-based analyst at Societe Generale SA. \u201cThe irony is that back in 1998, when he was negotiating for Dasa with British Aerospace, his side was the junior partner.

The unit competed with Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) and Jet2.com at its East Midlands hub, and overlapped with Ryanair in Birmingham. Both rivals, together with carriers including EasyJet Plc (EZJ) , also have bases in cities as little as 50 miles to the north.\nAll employees who are losing their jobs will be able to apply for any vacancies at British Airways, BMIbaby spokeswoman Naomi Bustin said separately. The carrier operated 14 Boeing Co. (BA) 737 aircraft, flying more than 700 services a week in the peak season to 23 European destinations, according to its website.\nGerman turnaround specialist Intro Aviation GmbH, which had expressed an interest in BMIbaby, ended talks after Cologne- based Lufthansa rejected a non-binding offer, Managing Director Peter Oncken said in April. Charter carrier ACL also dropped plans to make a bid, a person familiar with the matter has said.\nReduced Price\nIAG completed the acquisition of BMI on April 20 to boost its position at London\u2019s overcrowded Heathrow airport . Lufthansa reduced the agreed price of 172.5 million pounds ($274 million) by an undisclosed amount after failing to first offload BMIbaby and BMI Regional, an asset IAG later sold to Sector Aviation Holdings Ltd. for 8 million pounds in a deal announced May 10.\nIAG\u2019s passenger traffic rose 5 percent last month, the carrier said today, with premium travel increasing almost 13 percent and economy up 3.9 percent.\nThe market remains unchanged since the company\u2019s last financial statement on Aug. 3, it said, with trading \u201cfirm\u201d at Heathrow and the Iberia unit\u2019s Madrid base hurt by \u201cweak economic conditions,\u201d with short-haul traffic most affected.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Chris Jasper in London at cjasper@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Chad Thomas at cthomas16@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:45:19", "post_time": "2012-09-05 12:17:22", "author": "Chris Jasper", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-05/british-airways-to-shut-bmibaby-this-weekend-with-450-job-losses.html", "title": "British Airways to Shut BMIbaby This Weekend With 450 Job Losses", "post_date": "2012-09-05", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "aabd50908dd9bd698ba7555d691f13ac186acb38"}, {"content": "JetBlue Shuns AMR Merger Talks as CEO Seeks No Deals\nBy Mary Schlangenstein - 2012-08-21T20:10:33Z\nJetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU) has \u201cno interest\u201d in a merger with AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) \u2019s bankrupt American Airlines and hasn\u2019t received a document that would allow an exchange of confidential information between the carriers.\nAfter being identified by AMR last month as likely to get a non-disclosure agreement, JetBlue has held no talks with the larger airline about a combination, Chief Executive Dave Barger said yesterday in an interview at Bloomberg\u2019s headquarters in New York .\n\u201cWe have not received a non-disclosure agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in receiving a non-disclosure agreement from American Airlines.\u201d\nBarger\u2019s comment underscored New York-based JetBlue\u2019s aversion to the industry deal-making since 2008 that created the world\u2019s two biggest airlines, United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) and Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) He said JetBlue will grow with steps such as adding flight slots at airports including Washington\u2019s Reagan National and increasing service in San Juan , Puerto Rico .\n\u201cWe\u2019re just not interested in participating in the consolidation path, either being acquired or in acquiring another company,\u201d said Barger, 54. \u201cIndependence is our plan today and it\u2019s our path on a go-forward basis.\u201d\nSigning a non-disclosure agreement is a first step in merger discussions. It gives prospective partners access to each other\u2019s financial records on condition that the information not be shared.\nUS Airways\nAMR sent a non-disclosure agreement last month to US Airways Group Inc. (LCC) , which is weighing its own takeover bid. At a July meeting of AMR\u2019s unsecured creditors committee, Chief Executive Officer Tom Horton also identified Alaska Airlines, Frontier Airlines and Virgin America Inc. as possible merger partners, a person familiar with the situation said at the time.\nThat would fit with Horton\u2019s stated goal of preferring to have AMR emerge from bankruptcy as a stand-alone company and then consider mergers to broaden American\u2019s network. While JetBlue has been regarded as a possible target for AMR, Barger\u2019s disavowal of interest dimmed those prospects.\n\u201cJetBlue doesn\u2019t seem to be on the same page as that speculation would imply,\u201d said Jeff Kauffman, a Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. analyst in New York. \u201cThat could attack the credibility of the stand-alone plan.\u201d\nAirline Stocks\nUS Airways , whose shares have more than doubled this year as it circles AMR, jumped 7.9 percent to $11.43 in New York to lead a rally among airlines. The gain was the largest since May 24. JetBlue was unchanged at the close.\nMichael Trevino , a spokesman for Fort Worth, Texas-based American, declined yesterday to identify any recipients of the agreements or discuss Barger\u2019s comments.\n\u201cWe have under way a thorough, objective, fact-based process to review our strategic alternatives and compare them to our own strong plan,\u201d Trevino said. \u201cWe have sent NDA\u2019s to multiple parties and, beyond that, we will not comment on the process.\u201d\nJetBlue\u2019s growth strategy includes expanding in Boston, San Juan and Central America, said Barger, who became CEO in May 2007. The sixth-largest U.S. airline by traffic also wants to boost flights at Washington\u2019s Reagan National airport and New York\u2019s LaGuardia, he said.\nThose airports have restrictions on takeoff and landing slots, which must be purchased or traded from another airline. Adding flights outside the U.S. may require government approvals for so-called route authorities.\nGates, Slots\n\u201cOut of the consolidation and merger activity, we are interested in slots, we are interested in purchasing gates, we are interested in route authorities,\u201d Barger said. \u201cWe have 17 flights a day at Reagan National . It could easily be 50 or 75 or 100 departures a day, if we had the slots.\u201d\nAmerican has figured in industry discussions about possible tie-ups because it wasn\u2019t involved in the major deals at the end of the last decade. New York is American\u2019s chief East Coast hub for trans-Atlantic flights, as well as JetBlue\u2019s biggest base.\nThe carriers have a so-called interline agreement for some New York and Boston flights that has been the subject of recent conversations, Barger said. That accord lets each airline sell tickets on specific partner flights and check bags on one itinerary, with revenue going to the flight\u2019s operator.\nJetBlue travelers can book on American to 15 foreign cities from New York and Boston, while fliers to the two destinations on American jets from abroad can reach 26 U.S. cities via JetBlue. They also share flight slots in Washington and New York.\nBarger said JetBlue\u2019s network, which now stretches as far south as Colombia, is at its geographic limit because of the range of the carrier\u2019s Airbus SAS A320 jets. Those single-aisle planes form the backbone of its fleet, bolstered by Embraer SA (EMBR3) E190s.\nJetBlue hasn\u2019t ruled out adding wide-body Airbus planes to extend flights farther into South America , he said.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Mary Schlangenstein in New York at maryc.s@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Ed Dufner at edufner@bloomberg.net\nJetBlue CEO Dave Barger\nScott Eells/Bloomberg\nJetBlue Airways Corp.

In fact, it is the newest means of monitoring drug and arms traffickers, and the latest result of a military buildup that is attracting companies from Boeing Co. (BA) to Odebrecht to Thales SA.\nThe suppliers, facing possible reductions in defense spending in the U.S., U.K. and countries worldwide, are jockeying to take a bigger share of Brazil\u2019s defense contracts. The industry has expanded 236 percent in the past four years to 12 billion reais ($5.9 billion) in annual spending, according to the Defense Ministry.\nBrazil is replacing aging military equipment to develop its own technology and create jobs, industry executives say. The nation of more than 210 million people has avoided armed conflicts with its 10 neighbors for 142 years and hasn\u2019t been involved in a war since 1945.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very promising market, everybody knows Brazil\u2019s importance is growing in the global arena,\u201d said Ramiro Brasil, administrative manager at Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil-based Flight Technologies , which delivered three prototype drone aircraft to the army last year and is testing its smaller, hand- launched model. \u201cFinally there are public policies that sustain the defense industry.\u201d\nBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff in March signed legislation that grants a series of tax breaks over five years for companies providing strategic defense goods and services. The move is part of a broader strategy, announced in 2008, to shift Brazil\u2019s capabilities away from conventional warfare to surveillance and protection of infrastructure and natural resources, particularly in the Amazon and offshore regions.\nDefense Companies\nThe number of foreign and domestic defense companies in Brazil jumped to 150 last year from 39 in 2007, with sales of $3.5 billion, according to the Brazilian Defense and Security Industries Association, or ABIMDE. The government has signed contracts for equipment worth more than $12 billion and the Defense Ministry estimates the armed forces will need annual investments of 20 billion reais over the next two decades.\nBrazil\u2019s main construction companies, including Odebrecht and Queiroz Galvao SA, are joining in the competition for contracts. Belo Horizonte , Brazil-based Andrade Gutierrez SA created a defense joint venture in January with aerospace and industrial electronics company Thales SA (HO) of France.\nEmbraer SA (EMBR3) , the world\u2019s fourth-largest airplane maker, projects defense revenue to grow 17 percent this year to 1 billion reais and to account for a quarter of its income by 2020, up from 14.7 percent now, according to an e-mail from the Sao Jose dos Campos-based company. Its shares rose 2.41 percent at 1:37 p.m. local time, compared with a 1.1 percent rise for the Bovespa index.\n\u2018Potential Positive\u2019\n\u201cWe view the company\u2019s increasing revenues in the defense segment as a potential positive in the next few years,\u201d Standard and Poor\u2019s said in a June report.\nShares in Forjas Taurus SA (FJTA4) , the Porto Alegre , Brazil-based company that makes firearms, rose 7.28 percent today. It is up 100 percent for the year, compared with the Bovespa\u2019s gain of 3.7 percent.\nUnderlying the need to beef up a military with 328,000 troops, the second-largest force in the Americas, is a conviction among policy makers that the country\u2019s defensive capacity should be in line with its growing economic clout.\n\u201cIn the past we had limited budgets because of our large foreign and social debts,\u201d army General Aderico Mattioli, head of product development at the Defense Ministry , said in an interview. \u201cWith the new economic reality we can think of the country\u2019s defense again.\u201d\nShare of GDP\nWhile Brazil last year overtook the U.K. to become the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy, its defense spending as a share of gross domestic product ranked it 88th among 172 countries, according to the latest U.S. Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook. Last year Brazil spent 61.8 billion reais, or 1.5 percent of GDP, according to the Defense Ministry. The U.S. spent 5.1 percent of GDP on defense last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nSome entrepreneurs are wary that slower economic growth may lead policymakers to cut the defense budget . Economists surveyed by the central bank forecast 1.8 percent growth this year, down from 7.5 percent in 2010 and 2.7 percent last year.\n\u201cThere\u2019s some uncertainty whether spending will continue at its current rate,\u201d said Luiz Carlos Teixeira, chief executive officer of Sao Jose dos Campos-based IACIT , which is developing maritime and meteorological radars able to detect tsunamis and low flying aircraft. Shifts in spending are particularly disruptive to small- and medium-sized companies that often depend on a few defense contracts, Teixeira said.\nBorder Defense\nThe government is pushing ahead with planned projects and last week took offers for its border defense system, which may include the type of unmanned aircraft tested by Flight Technologies over the Paraiba Valley.\nBrazil\u2019s discovery of 5 billion to 8 billion barrels of offshore oil reserves in 2007 has triggered a new awareness of security needs in a country that has 4,625 miles of coastline and limited naval capabilities, including one aircraft carrier , built in 1960.\n\u201cNobody wants to go to war, but when you discover huge oil reserves 200 miles off your coast, somebody has to protect them,\u201d ABIMDE\u2019s executive vice-president, retired Admiral Carlos Pierantoni, said in a June telephone interview. Pierantoni expressed concern over a possible scenario in which pirates took control of an offshore oil platform and announced, \u201c \u2018Either you give me $200 million or I\u2019ll blow it up.\u2019 \u201d\nHelibras, EADS\nThe defense push has led foreign companies to set up shop or expand production capacity in Brazil. Helibras, controlled by Toulouse, France-based European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co., this year will begin production of 46 of 50 EC725 helicopters worth 1.8 billion euros ($2.2 billion) for Brazil\u2019s armed forces at a new plant in Minas Gerais state, the company said in an e- mail. The first four were made in Europe. A civilian version of the helicopter is designed to ferry supplies and personnel to offshore oil rigs.\nBoeing\u2019s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, French Dassault Aviation SA (AM) \u2019s Rafale and Swedish Saab AB (SAABB) \u2019s Gripen are competing for a deal to deliver 36 jet fighters that the U.S. State Department says is worth as much as $4 billion. The decision has been repeatedly delayed, and Rousseff\u2019s office in an e-mail said it has no estimate of when it may occur.\nIn a departure from previous defense contracts, foreign investors, including the winning jet fighter contractor, will be expected to partner with local companies, transfer technology and maximize local production. \u201cWe have no aversion to foreign capital, what we want is a commitment to develop national production capacity,\u201d said Mattioli.\nSharing Know-How\nBoeing agreed in June to share know-how and market studies with Embraer for the KC-390, a military cargo aircraft to be built in Brazil. The companies will offer the plane as a global competitor to Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) \u2019s Hercules C-130.\nChicago-based Boeing in March chose AEL Sistemas, a subsidiary of Israel\u2019s Elbit Systems Ltd. (ESLT) located in Brazil\u2019s Rio Grande do Sul state, to develop and produce advanced cockpit avionics, and is looking for local partners in other defense sectors. Brazil is \u201can opportunity\u201d as a defense market, production and research center, Donna Hrinak, president of Boeing Brazil, said by phone from Rio de Janeiro.\nItaly\u2019s Iveco SpA this year will build the first of 2,044 armored personnel carriers worth a total of 2 billion euros at a plant in Sete Lagoas in Minas Gerais state.\nFrance\u2019s DCNS SA and Brazil\u2019s Construtora Norberto Odebrecht SA are building five submarines, one of them nuclear- powered, in Rio de Janeiro state, costing the government 9.6 billion reais between 2012 and 2015, the Defense Ministry said.\nNiche Markets\nBased in the Sao Jose dos Campos industrial hub near Sao Paulo, Avibras Industria Aeroespacial SA has created niche markets for itself abroad. Foreign sales make up 80 percent of Avibras\u2019s $210 million in annual revenue, and the Middle East is the biggest client for its flagship export item of missiles and rockets. U.S.-led troops used Avibras\u2019s Astros II multiple rocket launcher to attack Iraqi forces in Operation Desert Storm during the Gulf War .\nBrazil is following the same model other defense exporters have. \u201cThe government helps a little to develop products and then you start exporting, generate profits, jobs and foreign exchange,\u201d said Sami Youssef Hassuani, president of Avibras.\nProducts containing sensitive U.S. components could face export limitations under U.S. law. In 2006 the U.S. government blocked Embraer\u2019s sale of Super Tucano turboprops to Venezuela .\n$1 Billion\nEmbraer and its partner Sierra Nevada Corp. are competing against Hawker Beechcraft Corp. for a U.S. Air Force contract worth as much as $1 billion to deliver light-attack aircraft to the Afghan military after the first contract it won was canceled in February because Hawker filed a suit over the decision. On July 10, Embraer signed a contract for a second batch of 8 Super Tucano planes to Indonesia\u2019s air force.\nWhile a growing defense industry in Latin America would have been unwelcome in Washington only a few decades ago, Brazil now is seen as a regional and global source of stability, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said in April.\n\u201cThere was a time when the United States discouraged developing military capability in countries in Latin and Central America,\u201d Panetta told reporters after meeting Defense Minister Celso Amorim in Brasilia. \u201cThe fact is today, we think the development of those kinds of capabilities is important and if we can use those capabilities to develop the kind of innovative partnerships that I\u2019m talking about, that will advance the security in this region.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Raymond Colitt in Brasilia at rcolitt@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Philip Sanders at psanders@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:45:27", "post_time": "2012-08-16 12:48:21", "author": "Raymond Colitt", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-16/defense-spending-growth-lures-odebrecht-eads-corporate.html", "title": "Defense Spending Growth Lures Odebrecht, EADS: Corporate", "post_date": "2012-08-16", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "dc145bf9e96e974d67a66a7b3aa33118b0259d41"}, {"content": "Florida Space Coast Brightens on Jobs Increase\nBy Ian Katz - 2012-08-15T04:00:01Z\nBrian Medeiros was driving a Budweiser beer truck when he got a phone call saying he\u2019d been offered an aerospace-industry job 15 months after his position at the U.S. space shuttle program was eliminated. He pulled over and sobbed in relief.\n\u201cI started bawling my eyes out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a blessing. It was an opportunity to use every skill I\u2019ve developed.\u201d\nMedeiros, 51, spent a decade at Kennedy Space Center in Florida \u2019s 72-mile-long Space Coast handling highly toxic fuels for shuttle contractor United Space Alliance LLC. He\u2019s now a lead technician at the executive-jet assembly plant Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer SA (EMBR3) opened in nearby Melbourne , Florida, in February 2011.\nA year after the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shut down the shuttle program, eliminating at least 7,000 contractor jobs in the area, the employment outlook is improving. Joblessness in central Florida\u2019s eastern coast was 9.4 percent in June, down from 11.7 percent in August 2011, the month after the last shuttle launch. Unemployment in Florida , a swing state in the 2012 presidential election, was 8.6 percent in June, down from 10.7 percent a year earlier.\nSting, Impact\n\u201cCertainly the pain is very real for those still looking for work,\u201d said Dina Reider-Hicks, a senior director at the Economic Development Commission of Florida\u2019s Space Coast. \u201cThere has been a sting, there has been an impact. But it hasn\u2019t been as severe as people thought.\u201d Some local business leaders thought that the unemployment rate could rise to the high teens, she said.\nEmbraer plans to employ at least 200 people at the assembly plant and has 50 at a customer-service center it opened next door in December. The jet maker has said it will create another 200 jobs over five years at an engineering facility due to open across the street in 2013.\nBoeing Co. (BA) has said it will create 550 jobs by the end of 2015 for a commercial crew program to provide flights to the international space station . Harris Corp. (HRS) , which provides information-technology services to the government, is building an engineering center in Brevard County that could add 100 jobs and 300 construction positions in the next three years.\nStill, many former shuttle workers are struggling to find work.\nNo Offers\nFrancine Myers, 53, who started at the space center in 1981, lost her position as a logistics specialist in July 2011. She\u2019s had two job interviews and no offers since then.\nMyers, who has two grown children and lives alone in Titusville, about 40 miles north of Melbourne, tried to squeeze as much as she could from her 26 weeks of severance.\n\u201cI\u2019m about at the end of that,\u201d she said over a Greek salad at Mr. Submarine & Salads, where sandwiches are named for the Discovery, Columbia and Challenger shuttles. \u201cI need to find a job.\u201d\nMyers said she doesn\u2019t have health insurance and must take three kinds of insulin for her diabetes, in addition to pills for her blood pressure and thyroid condition.\nIn between looking for work on websites run by CareerBuilder Inc. and Monster Worldwide Inc. (MWW) , Myers is trying to get a business-administration degree at Barry University \u2019s Cape Canaveral branch. She said a program at Brevard Workforce, a county agency that helps retrain dismissed workers, covers the cost.\nSmall Business\nHer cousin, Fred Harvey Jr., took an entrepreneurship course through Brevard Workforce after losing his job with the shuttle program and has opened Fred\u2019s Auto Butler Mobile Detailing Services, a small business that spiffs up cars, boats and airplanes.\nLike many former shuttle employees, Myers, who worked on every launch except the first going back to 1981, misses the sense of patriotism and pride.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how many launches you see, every one still gives you goose bumps,\u201d she said. She remembers feeling her heart sink watching the January 1986 Challenger explosion from the porch of her grandmother\u2019s house. She said she saw the smoke and thought, \u201cWait a minute. It\u2019s not supposed to look like that.\u201d\nThe culture of the industry has become embedded in Brevard County since Kennedy Space Center opened 50 years ago. It\u2019s hard to drive more than a few minutes without passing a street named for an astronaut, such as Ronald McNair of the Challenger, or a space vehicle, like Apollo Road or Columbia Boulevard. The local area code is 321, for the countdown before liftoff.\nReliably Republican\nWhile Brevard County is reliably Republican, it\u2019s in a battleground state for presidential candidates. In 2008, when Florida sided with Democrat Barack Obama , Brevard\u2019s vote went to Republican John McCain : 157,589 to 127,620.\nUntil companies such as Embraer and Boeing finish expanding, unemployed workers face a \u201cshort-term gap\u201d to find jobs with pay comparable to what they received from shuttle contractors, said Marcia Gaedcke, president of the Titusville Area Chamber of Commerce.\n\u201cManaging that gap is the challenge,\u201d Gaedcke said. \u201cFrom the medium- to long-term, we\u2019ll be fine, we\u2019ll see growth.\u201d\nEmbraer technician Medeiros, an intense, beefy man with a small beard and salt-and-pepper hair, took the lower-paying job at a local beer distributor \u201cjust to keep myself mentally in the game,\u201d he said. Myers interviewed for a position that would have paid $41,000, compared with $55,000 she made at the space center. She said she probably would have taken the job had she gotten an offer.\nFormer Workers\nSome former shuttle workers have left the Space Coast, hurting the local economy.\nThe county\u2019s foreclosure rate was 10.8 percent in May, one percentage point more than in July 2011 when the shuttle program shut down, according to CoreLogic Inc. It reached a high of 11.1 percent in February.\nKyra Morgan, 55, who runs a cleaning service in Titusville, said four of her clients moved away in one week alone this month to find jobs elsewhere.\n\u201cIt trickles down,\u201d said Morgan, whose husband lost his job as a shuttle mechanic.\nOne of the biggest problems for the business community is \u201cfighting the perception a lot of people have that NASA has shut down,\u201d the chamber\u2019s Gaedcke said.\n$900 Million\nIn fact, NASA said Aug. 3 that Boeing and Hawthorne, California-based Space Exploration Technologies Corp. won a combined $900 million in contracts from the agency to design and develop spacecraft that can carry astronauts. Sierra Nevada Corp. of Sparks, Nevada, won a $212.5 million contract. The agreements will add an undetermined number of jobs to the Space Coast, the development commission\u2019s Reider-Hicks said.\nOne advantage for the area is the availability of aerospace talent. That was a factor in Embraer\u2019s decision to assemble jets in Melbourne and is reflected in the fact that one-quarter of the plant\u2019s employees have worked on NASA projects, said Phil Krull, managing director at the facility.\nWhen hiring former space-shuttle workers, Krull tries to make sure they can adapt from focusing on one shuttle for months at a time to production of up to eight jets a month. Many of the employees bring the passion they had at the space center to Embraer and become some of the company\u2019s best representatives, he said.\nFor Medeiros, who has two adult children in addition to two teen-aged stepchildren living with him and his wife, the loss of his space-shuttle job created \u201ca big black void\u201d in his life, he said.\nAsked about his family\u2019s reaction when he got his new position last year, Medeiros began to choke up with emotion before quickly collecting himself. He said he had feared he wouldn\u2019t be able to get back into the aerospace industry and was surprised when he got the call from Embraer.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think they would be interested in me,\u201d he said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ian Katz in Melbourne, Florida, at ikatz2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Chris Wellisz at cwellisz@bloomberg.net\nFlorida Brightens as Engineer Flees Beer Truck for Embraer\nPaulo Fridman/Bloomberg\nEmbraer plans to employ at least 200 people at the assembly plant and has 50 at a customer-service center it opened next door in December.\nEmbraer plans to employ at least 200 people at the assembly plant and has 50 at a customer-service center it opened next door in December.

(BA) 767s, Chief Executive Officer Calin Rovinescu said on an earnings call today. Routes will include leisure destinations such as Las Vegas , Mexico and Florida .\n\u201cThis agreement is a key element in the blueprint that will allow Air Canada to not only compete more effectively, but also renew growth after years of stagnation,\u201d he said.\nAir Canada had the highest annual cost to fly a single seat a mile of any North American airline for the past three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Industries. Its fleet is twice the average age of rival WestJet Airlines Ltd. (WJA) , the most recent data show, and Air Canada said today it will conduct a review to determine which aircraft need replacing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still periods of lots of restructuring they have to work through and there\u2019s going to be lots of noise around the name but I think they have enough momentum and enough dominoes in play they can probably extract some good cost savings in various initiatives across the board,\u201d said David Newman, a Cormark Securities Inc. analyst in Toronto who raised his rating to speculative buy from market perform on Aug. 1.\nEarnings Miss\nAir Canada reported a second-quarter adjusted loss of 5 Canadian cents a share today, wider than the 1-cent average of analysts\u2019 estimates, after labor disruptions and the closing of a maintenance provider curbed bookings.\nIncluding a currency-exchange loss and other expenses, net loss widened to C$96 million, or 35 cents a share, from C$46 million, or 17 cents, a year earlier. The report marked Air Canada (AC/A) \u2019s sixth consecutive unprofitable quarter. Operating expenses for each seat flown a mile increased 2.3 percent from the same period a year ago, Air Canada said.\n\u201cThe rest of the industry has been moving ahead to capture a large portion of the ever-growing leisure or low-cost market,\u201dRovinescu said on the call. \u201cThe low-cost model contemplated in the agreement would allow us to maintain or grow Air Canada\u2019s presence in the low-cost market where we are no longer able to compete against new entrants.\u201d\nFull-service carriers in North America have a troubled history running low-cost units. In 2008 surging fuel prices and an industrywide contraction forced United Airlines to shut down its low-cost Ted airline.\nSong Ends\nDelta Air Lines Inc. folded its Song unit in 2006, and reduced demand after the Sept. 11 attacks put an end to Delta Express, United Shuttle and US Airways \u2019 Metrojet.\nOne success story is Australia \u2019s Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN) which introduced its low-cost Jetstar Airways Ltd. in 2004.\nIn the early part of the decade Qantas was also struggling with high costs and competition from a low-cost carrier, Russell Shaw , an analyst with Macquarie Group Ltd. in Sydney, said in an e-mail. Qantas\u2019 solution was a low-cost carrier with separate labor contracts.\n\u201cIt then successfully segmented its own network into premium and leisure routes, such that Jetstar did not compete directly against Qantas on any route,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere there was overlap, the flight times were different to cater to different markets.\u201d\nQantas\u2019 control of Jetstar was key to making sure the airlines didn\u2019t compete, Shaw said, and this allowed Qantas to apply best practices from its low-cost unit in its main business, including paying Qantas employees at Jetstar rates.\nFleet Review\nLow-cost WestJet Airlines Ltd. plans to increase its competition with Air Canada by starting a regional carrier next year that will use Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) \u2019s new Q400 turboprop jets.\nAir Canada said today its narrow-body Embraer SA (EMBR3) 175s, which joined the fleet in 2005, may be succeeded by newer, more fuel-efficient planes.\nCormark\u2019s Newman said Air Canada could move as many as 60 new jets into its regional operations. Replacing the Embraer jets with more efficient jets could save between C$30 million to C$50 million, he said in an interview.\n\u201cIt would make sense, at least from my perspective, that they would eliminate those from their fleet, because they\u2019re probably not cost-efficient,\u201d Cameron Doerksen , an analyst with National Bank Financial, said by phone yesterday.\nAir Canada fell 7.8 percent to C$1.06 in Toronto today, its largest drop since February. The shares have gained 7.1 percent this year.\nPension Solvency\nThe carrier said the recent labor deals will save it C$1.1 billion in pension costs. Even with those savings, the company still faces a C$3.1 billion pension solvency deficit and is in discussions with its unions and Canada\u2019s finance department about the possibility of extending a moratorium on funding payments.\nWithout the extension, the airline said it will face more than C$900 million of pension payments in 2012 and 2013.\n\u201cTransformational change is not easy, especially in the case of a legacy carrier with high fixed costs, unionized labor, and a huge and onerous pension commitment,\u201d Rovinescu said on the call. Still, with principal labor agreements complete and potential growth from the low-cost airline, \u201cwe are well positioned to transform Air Canada into a more competitive, sustainable and solidly profitable airline.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Frederic Tomesco in Montreal at tomesco@bloomberg.net ; Ari Altstedter in Toronto at aaltstedter@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Ed Dufner at edufner@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:45:32", "post_time": "2012-08-08 16:24:10", "author": "Ari Altstedter", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-08/air-canada-loss-passes-estimates-as-labor-spat-cuts-sales.html", "title": "Air Canada Targets Renewed Growth With Low-Cost Unit", "post_date": "2012-08-08", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "98dfec98ef55c603603317636b5b1186bb844ba5"}, {"content": "Boeing Sees $100 Billion Potential Sales in Brazil, Estado Says\nBy Karen Eeuwens - 2012-07-22T12:04:49Z\nBoeing Co.

(TXT) is considering a bid for part or all of Hawker Beechcraft Inc., the bankrupt business-jet maker in exclusive talks with China\u2019s Superior Aviation Beijing Co.\n\u201cWe have the same general view, these are assets in which we have an interest, but it would have to be at a value that we think is appropriate,\u201d Textron Chief Executive Officer Scott Donnelly said on an earnings conference call with analysts today.\nTextron might bid on the whole company or just on Hawker Beechcraft\u2019s defense business, which isn\u2019t part of the \u201cpretty high number\u201d of $1.79 billion in the Superior Aviation deal being worked out, Donnelly said.\nA U.S. bankruptcy judge this week agreed to allow Hawker, owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Onex Corp., to negotiate exclusively with Superior for 45 days, after which other interested parties may try to top the deal in a court-supervised auction.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s the right value and would be accretive for our business, then absolutely we\u2019re interested,\u201d Donnelly said.\nHawker unveiled a plan earlier this month to sell itself to Superior Aviation to avoid having to shut down its jet operations and to better compete in the growing Chinese market.\nSuch a deal wouldn\u2019t hurt Textron\u2019s Cessna airplane unit, which is better positioned in China than Wichita, Kansas-based Hawker, said Cai von Rumohr, a Cowen & Co. analyst in Boston who has an outperform rating on the stock.\nChina Production\nCessna, which is also based in Wichita, signed a preliminary agreement earlier this year with Aviation Industry Corp. of China, known as AVIC, and the city of Chengdu to open a midsize business-jet factory.\nHawker would only be able to challenge Cessna if it moved production to China, Von Rumohr wrote in a July 13 note. Superior Aviation promised this week to \u201caggressively work\u201d to retain jobs and expand Hawker\u2019s factories in the U.S.\nSuperior Aviation and its owners, including a company controlled by the Beijing government, have \u201cno meaningful aerospace expertise,\u201d Von Rumohr wrote.\nTextron\u2019s talks with AVIC are continuing, Donnelly said today.\n\u201cIf in fact the Chinese do buy Hawker, then it means Hawker\u2019s still in the market,\u201d and competition would continue as usual, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think by any means we\u2019ll be the only guy to sell in China.\u201d\nTextron Forecast\nDonnelly reiterated Textron\u2019s full-year forecast even after beating analysts\u2019 estimates for second-quarter profit, basing his conservatism on a weak outlook for Cessna. Earnings per share from continuing operations in 2012 will be between $1.80 and $2, he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s enough uncertainty out there in the economy and the markets around the world it\u2019s best to still anticipate it\u2019s going to be a tough back half,\u201d he said. Cessna also faces increased spending on research and development as it works on newly announced jet models, he said.\nDonnelly said he has a \u201creasonable\u201d ability to forecast profit at the Bell Helicopters and Industrial units.\nAt Cessna, where orders are placed and delivered in a three- to six-month window, \u201cI still worry about the back half of the year in terms of what the market is going to look like,\u201d he said.\nOn Sidelines\nSome potential customers in the U.S. are sitting on the sidelines until they see the outcome of November\u2019s presidential and congressional elections and determine what that means for changes to policy such as the U.S. government debt ceiling.\nIt\u2019s also impossible to predict what Congress will do with military spending cuts and how that might affect Textron Systems, the defense unit, he said.\n\u201cKnowing where the cuts ultimately will come at this point would be absolute guesswork.\u201d\nAdjusted earnings rose to 58 cents a share in the three months through June, from 29 cents a year earlier, the Providence, Rhode Island-based company said in a statement.\nThe average of 15 analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 44 cents. Net income almost doubled to $172 million from $90 million. Sales gained 11 percent to $3.02 billion.\nTextron surged 12 percent to $26.50 at the close in New York , the biggest daily jump since Jan. 25. The shares have gained 43 percent this year.\nRevenue and profit increased in the Cessna, Bell, Industrial and Finance units and declined at Textron Systems.\nCessna delivered 49 Citation jets in the quarter, up from 38 a year earlier. The planemaker\u2019s backlog continued its slide and was down by $196 million at the end of June to $1.5 billion.\nBell delivered 47 commercial helicopters, more than twice the 22 shipped a year ago, though it handed over two fewer military aircraft.

That will reduce its reliance on pulp, which accounted for about 94 percent of its 5.9 billion reais ($2.9 billion) in sales last year, he said. The company may build as many as ten more biofuel plants through 2020.\n\u201cA lot of players are building capacity and we are going to have an oversupply\u201d of pulp in the next few years, he said. The planned biofuel plant is \u201can amazing project that will give us very high competitiveness.\u201d\nThe fuel plant is the result of a joint venture Fibria announced Oct. 3 with Wilmington, Delaware-based Ensyn Corp. , which has developed technology to convert wood into transportation fuel. Fibria also agreed to pay $20 million for 6 percent of closely held Ensyn and has the option of boosting its stake to 9 percent.\nThe facility will cost as much as $100 million and will be built next to one of Fibria\u2019s three pulp mills. The company expects to sell the output to U.S. distributors, which pay a premium for renewable fuels, Castelli said.\n\u201cWe want to add an extra portfolio that will be less capital intensive,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will maximize the value of forestry and also will be an anti-cyclical business.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Stephan Nielsen in Sao Paulo at snielsen8@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Reed Landberg at landberg@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:45:53", "post_time": "2012-10-09 15:20:04", "author": "Stephan Nielsen", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-09/fibria-plans-brazil-wood-to-fuel-plant-to-diversify-sales.html", "title": "Fibria Plans Brazil Wood-to-Fuel Plant to Diversify Sales", "post_date": "2012-10-09", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "5317525d92a40c1b1a415d6db39e5b47db255f0b"}, {"content": "Fibria Loser in Global Rally on Pulp Overstock: Corporate Brazil\nBy Ney Hayashi and Lucia Kassai - 2012-10-03T17:38:26Z\nFibria Celulose SA (FIBR3) , the world\u2019s largest pulp producer, is forecast to post the only share drop in the industry because it\u2019s more exposed to an oversupply of the commodity than any of its biggest competitors.\nThe stock will fall 10 percent in the next 12 months, according to the average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sao Paulo-based Klabin SA (KLBN4) may gain 0.9 percent in the period, the second-worst performance among the world\u2019s top 25 pulp producers by market value. Shandong Huatai Paper Co., China\u2019s largest newsprint maker, is forecast to rally 99 percent.\nFibria will face tougher competition as global capacity of eucalyptus pulp, used to make paper, expands by as much as 27 percent in the next 18 months, said Kevin Cohen, an analyst at Imperial Capital LLC. Fibria\u2019s sales may increase 1.8 percent in 2013, compared with a growth rate of 3.5 percent for local competitor Suzano Papel & Celulose SA and 15 percent for Shandong Huatai, both of which get at least 55 percent of their revenue from paper and cardboard rather than pulp.\nThere\u2019s a \u201ctidal wave of new capacity coming,\u201d Cohen said in a telephone interview yesterday from New York . \u201cThat\u2019s the wall of worry that investors have to climb if you are out to invest in the story,\u201d he said, referring to Fibria.\n\u2018Pretty Bearish\u2019\nThe outlook for pulp supply and prices may prompt Fibria, which sells the material to consumer-products makers Kimberly- Clark Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) , to drop a plan to expand its Tres Lagoas mill as the company seeks to limit investments and sell assets to cut debt. Chief Executive Officer Marcello Castelli said in August that although a final decision about the plant expansion hadn\u2019t been made yet, the plan wouldn\u2019t be submitted to the company\u2019s board this year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s positive to see the mill being canceled or delayed,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThey are the lowest-cost producer in the world, so if the lowest-cost producer in the world is cutting back on a project, delaying it or canceling it, if they are not moving forward with it, that\u2019s pretty bearish.\u201d\nFibria\u2019s press office declined to comment.\nConcern that Brazil \u2019s BNDES state development bank, Fibria\u2019s biggest shareholder, may sell part of its stake after a so-called lock-up period ends may also prevent Sao Paulo-based Fibria from rallying along with rivals.\nEnd of Lock-Up\nSome analysts are predicting BNDES may reduce its 30.4 percent stake by as much as two-thirds to as low as 11 percent when the lock-up ends on Oct. 29, said Stephen Atkinson, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets. The bank bought its stake in 2009 as part of a deal in which Fibria, formerly known as Votorantim Celulose & Papel SA, took over rival Aracruz Celulose SA following $3 billion in derivative losses.\n\u201cThe end of the lock-up could put some pressure on the stock, a lot depending on the outlook for the pulp market,\u201d Atkinson said in telephone interview from Montreal . \u201cIf you go back in time, probably the most stupid thing Votorantim did was to buy Aracruz. They overpaid for those assets and have been struggling ever since.\u201d\nAn official for BNDES, who asked not to be identified in accordance with the bank\u2019s policy, declined to comment on the plans after the end of the lock-up.\nFibria, which has gained 32 percent this year, trades at 0.67 times its book value, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a ratio of 0.38 for Suzano, whose shares have tumbled 20 percent in Sao Paulo . Pulp prices have gained 15 percent this year as paper makers rebuild stockpiles. Inventories jumped to 38 days of supply in July, up from 34 days at the end of last year, according to Helsinki-based FOEX Indexes Ltd.\n\u2018Improbable\u2019\nWhile the possibility BNDES will sell its stake in the company may hurt the stock\u2019s performance in the short term, the chances of a divestment are low, said Victor Penna, an analyst at Banco do Brasil SA. (BBAS3)\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible, but improbable,\u201d Penna, who rates the stock a buy, said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo. \u201cBNDES typically holds long-term investments, and they have been supporting the pulp sector for a long time.\u201d\nFibria raised 1.44 billion reais ($711 million) in a share sale this year and used the proceeds to cut debt. Pulp prices are expected to fall to an average of $690 a ton next year from $780 a ton now as new plants will add 4.3 million tons of capacity, Penna said.\n\u201cSlowing demand in Europe could be partially offset by a recovery in China ,\u201d Penna said. \u201cThough it looks like oversupply will end up tipping the scale.\u201d\nFirst Acquisition\nThe company agreed to buy a 6 percent stake of Wilmington, Delaware-based Ensyn Corp., a producer of biofuel from wood, for $20 million, Fibria\u2019s first acquisition since 2009, the pulpmaker said in a statement late yesterday.\nThe companies plan to form a venture in Brazil to produce heating oil, fuels and other chemicals from chip woods, according to the statement. Fibria has the option to raise its stake to as much as 9 percent by investing an additional $10 million and expects the deal to be concluded by the end of this month, the Brazilian company said.\nEnsyn is owned by Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Impax Asset Management Ltd. and a unit of Chevron Corp.

(TMB) is joining the revival among Canadian forest-product stocks as Chinese demand for bathroom tissue lifts pulp prices and lumber surges on a U.S. housing rebound.\nThe Montreal-based maker of pulp, softwood, hardwood and pine lumber, rose the most in almost a year yesterday after producers, including Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3) , the world\u2019s largest maker of hardwood pulp, raised prices for the raw material used in paper and tissue.\n\u201cUnderlying all this are huge increases in Chinese demand for tissue paper that\u2019s goosing demand for hardwood and softwood pulp,\u201d Brian McClay, founder of Brian McClay & Associates Inc., a Montreal-based pulp-industry consultancy, said yesterday by telephone.\nTembec, which is also benefiting from a recovery in U.S. housing demand, derived 59 percent of its C$1.74 billion ($1.77 billion) in 2011 revenue from pulp, 22 percent from forest products such as lumber, and 19 percent from paper.\n\u201cAs China becomes more and more urbanized, tens of millions of people every year are moving into apartments and dwellings with flush toilets and they\u2019re using more bathroom tissue,\u201d McClay said.\nLast year China consumed a record 6.74 million metric tons of tissue paper, virtually all of it the bathroom variety, about 19 percent more than in 2010, McClay said. New paper mills will probably increase the country\u2019s capacity to produce tissue this year by about 1.6 million tons, he said.\n\u201cWhile many people believe that tissue capacity is being overbuilt in China, tissue paper prices continues to rise,\u201d McClay said. \u201cThe outlook is for more of the same.\u201d\nPrice Rises\nFibria, based in Sao Paulo , announced price increases effective Oct. 1 for hardwood pulp in Asia , Europe and North America , with the North American price rising to $830 a ton, according to data compiled by RISI, a paper and forest industry information provider based in Bedford, Massachusetts .\nDomtar Corp. (UFS) was the first company to announce a $20 price increase for Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft pulp sold in North America and made from spruce, pine and fir sawmill chips, McClay said. Domtar was followed by Canfor Pulp Products Inc., Tembec, Mercer International Inc. (MERC) , and others, he added. The price increases, which are not generally made public, don\u2019t guarantee a rise, as some customers may not agree.\nTembec closed up 10 percent at C$2.25 in Toronto yesterday, its biggest gain since October 2011 and was up 0.9 percent at C$2.27 at 10:29 a.m. today. Vancouver-based Canfor Pulp Products Inc. (CFX) rose 6.8 percent to C$10.03 yesterday while Domtar Corp., North America\u2019s largest maker of office paper, gained 3.1 percent to C$78.22 in Toronto. All have declined this year through yesterday, with Tembec down 19 percent.\nChanging Media\nA combination of expected inventory restocking in China and rising pulp prices signals a \u201cmini-rally\u201d that will last through the first half of 2013, said Kevin Mason, Gibsons, British Columbia-based managing director of ERA Forest Products Research, said yesterday in a telephone interview.\nThe long-term outlook for pulp remains fragile as important consumers, such as newspapers and printing companies, struggle with a changing media landscape.\nCompanies with more exposure to lumber have led the rally in forest stocks this year as the U.S. housing market has rebounded and amid growing Chinese demand for wood building products. West Fraser Timber Co. (WFT) has gained 37 percent, while Western Forest Products Inc. (WEF) has risen 32 percent.\nPurchases of new U.S. homes in August held close to a two- year high. Sales dipped 0.3 percent to a 373,000 annual pace following a revised 374,000 rate in July that was higher than previously estimated and the strongest since April 2010, figures from the Commerce Department showed.\nPrices for 1,000 board feet of British Columbia benchmark spruce, pine or fir lumber have advanced 12 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nTembec is \u201cdeeply\u201d undervalued, Kevin Cohen, an analyst at Imperial Capital LLC in New York , said by phone. \u201cThey have a lot of exposure to lumber and the stock hasn\u2019t moved but lumber prices have moved.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Eric Lam in Toronto at elam87@bloomberg.net ; Christopher Donville in Vancouver at cjdonville@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Simon Casey at scasey4@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:46:06", "post_time": "2012-10-03 10:31:07", "author": "Christopher Donville , Eric Lam", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-03/tembec-joins-lumber-rally-as-tissues-lift-pulp.html", "title": "Tembec Joins Lumber Rally as Tissues Lift Pulp", "post_date": "2012-10-03", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "905106ce7de12b91342543800d08c36b72350d71"}, {"content": "Emerging Stocks Drop to 2-Week Low on Growth Concerns\nBy Michael Patterson and Weiyi Lim - 2012-09-26T21:30:45Z\nDeveloping-nation stocks fell, pushing the benchmark index down the most in two months, as falling commodities prices dragged down resource stocks and a U.S. Federal Reserve official said debt purchases probably won\u2019t spur growth.\nThe MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) retreated 1.1 percent to 990.37 at the close of trading in New York, the biggest decline since July 23.

(PG) as their currencies post the biggest declines since at least 1998.\nFor the first time in 13 years, the real, ruble and rupee are weakening the most among developing-nation currencies, while the yuan has depreciated more than in any other period since its 1994 devaluation. P&G, the world\u2019s largest consumer-goods maker, cut its profit forecast for the second time in two months last week in part because of currency losses. Brazil\u2019s Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3) , the biggest pulp producer, asked banks to loosen restrictions on dollar loans as the real hit a three-year low.\nInvestors are fleeing the four biggest emerging markets, known as the BRICs, after Brazil\u2019s consumer default rate rose to the highest level since 2009, prices for Russian oil exports fell to an 18-month low, India\u2019s budget deficit widened and Chinese home prices slumped. Investors are bracing for more losses as economic growth slows.\n\u201cI am quite bearish,\u201d Stephen Jen, a managing partner at hedge fund SLJ Macro Partners LLP and a former economist at the International Monetary Fund, said in a phone interview from London. \u201cWhen the global economy and capital flow slow down, it\u2019s going to expose a lot of problems in these countries and make people stop and ask questions. A run on the currency could be particularly ugly.\u201d\nRuble\u2019s Retreat\nCurrencies from Brazil, Russia and India will probably decline at least 15 percent further by year-end, said Jen, the former head of global currency research at Morgan Stanley.\nRussia\u2019s ruble lost 12 percent this quarter through today, the biggest drop among the 31 most-actively traded currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The 11 percent depreciation in the real and rupee was almost twice the retreat in the euro. China\u2019s yuan, which was kept unchanged during the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, fell 1 percent since March after the government widened the amount the currency is allowed to fluctuate each day.\nThe ruble sank 2.4 percent last week, while the rupee fell 2.9 percent to a record low against the dollar and the real dropped 0.8 percent.\nForeign Reserves\nIndia\u2019s currency rebounded 0.3 percent today as the government said it increased the amount of rupee-denominated debt overseas investors can own, one of several measures unveiled to support the currency. The yuan fell as much as 0.3 percent to 6.3827 per dollar, the weakest level since Nov. 29, before closing little changed. The ruble lost 0.3 percent.\nA decade after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) \u2019s Jim O\u2019Neill coined the term BRIC, China has become the second-largest economy while Brazil, India and Russia are among the 11 biggest worldwide. Their combined gross domestic product rose to $13.3 trillion last year from $2.8 trillion in 2002 as their share of the global economy increased to 19 percent from 8 percent, according to IMF data. Together, they control $4.4 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves, about 40 percent of the total.\nThe MSCI BRIC Index (MXBRIC) of shares has surged 281 percent during the past decade, compared with 34 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index (SPX) as the real and the yuan strengthened more than 30 percent. Local-currency debt in the BRIC nations returned an average 86 percent in dollar terms since data for JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes on all four countries began in October 2005, versus a 48 percent increase in U.S. Treasuries.\nExport Boost\nThe countries are still strong enough to account for 80 percent of growth at New York-based Goldman Sachs, the fifth- biggest U.S. bank by assets, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in Russia\u2019s second-largest city on June 21.\nWeaker currencies will stimulate economic expansion by making exports more competitive, said Warren Hyland, an emerging-market money manager at Schroder Investment Management, which oversees about $319 billion worldwide. He\u2019s been buying ruble bonds of Russian companies.\nEarnings at the nation\u2019s commodity producers, including OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (GMKN) and Polyus Gold International Ltd. (PGIL) , will get a boost because their sales are in dollars while the bulk of their costs are in rubles, New York-based Morgan Stanley said in a report this month.\nWeaker currencies are hurting U.S. companies that rely on developing-nation revenue to offset slower growth in the U.S., Europe and Japan.\nLower Forecasts\nP&G, led by Chief Executive Officer Bob McDonald, said in a June 20 presentation at the Deutsche Bank Global Consumer Conference in Paris that foreign-currency fluctuations will cut 2013 earnings growth for the maker of Tide washing detergent and Bounty paper towels by about 4 percentage points. China is the Cincinnati-based company\u2019s second-largest market and some of the firm\u2019s biggest businesses are in Russia and Brazil, P&G said.\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (PM) , the world\u2019s largest listed tobacco company, reduced its 2012 earnings forecast the next day because of currency swings. The New York-based maker of Marlboro cigarettes gets more than 40 percent of its operating profit from Asia and Latin America , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nPandit\u2019s Expansion\nA weaker real and lower interest rates in Brazil may reduce Coca-Cola Co. (KO) \u2019s second-quarter profit by $30 million, according to JPMorgan. The Atlanta-based company left about $3 billion in cash in Brazil at the end of 2011 to take advantage of the country\u2019s higher interest rates, Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said in a conference call in February. Half of the positions were left unhedged, he said.\nBrazil\u2019s central bank President Alexandre Tombini has cut the benchmark Selic rate by 2.5 percentage points this year to 8.5 percent, while the real has depreciated 9.7 percent.\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned by Coke\u2019s reliance on this income source,\u201d JPMorgan analysts led by John Faucher wrote in a note to clients on June 7, reducing their 2012 profit estimate to $4 a share from $4.06.\nKent Landers , a spokesman for Coca-Cola, declined to comment.\nCitigroup Inc. (C) , which has been expanding in Latin America and Asia under Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit , may take a $3 billion to $5 billion \u201chit\u201d this quarter related to foreign exchange losses, Charles Peabody, a New York-based analyst at Portales Partners LLC, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on June 20. The losses may reduce Citigroup\u2019s book value, or assets minus liabilities, he said.\nFibria Loans\nPeabody, whose recommendations on shares of New York-based Citigroup during the past year produced the highest total return among 31 forecasters tracked by Bloomberg, cut his rating on the stock to the equivalent of sell from buy in March.\n\u201cCiti\u2019s unique global footprint and exposure to the higher economic growth regions of the world will drive above-average book value growth over time,\u201d Jon Diat, a Citigroup spokesman, said in an e-mail. \u201cThe suggestion that having non-U.S. exposure is somehow detrimental to Citi\u2019s ability to continue to grow value over time is simply wrong.\u201d\nLocal companies in the BRIC countries are also being hurt. Sao Paulo-based Fibria said on June 11 that it renegotiated loan covenants after the real\u2019s decline increased the cost of servicing foreign obligations. About 90 percent of the company\u2019s net debt is in dollars, according to company filings.\nYuan Debt\nThe rupee\u2019s drop has hurt Indian companies by fueling inflation and reducing the scope for lower borrowing costs, said V. Ashok, the chief financial officer of Essar Group, the utility and shipping company owned by billionaire brothers Shashi and Ravi Ruia . India\u2019s central bank unexpectedly left interest rates unchanged on June 18.\n\u201cOne has no clue where it is going to end,\u201d Ashok said in a June 22 phone interview from Mumbai. \u201cThe uncertainty and the volatility is the biggest concern.\u201d\nA weaker yuan is sapping demand for local-currency debt sold in Hong Kong, where international investors speculate on China\u2019s foreign exchange rate. The average yield rose to a four- month high of 5.35 percent on June 5 from 4.82 percent at the end of March, according to data compiled by Bank of America Corp. Wang Changshun, chairman of Air China Ltd. (601111) , told reporters this month that the company\u2019s income from foreign-currency transactions will drop about 80 percent.\nBearish Bets\n\u201cAll the BRIC looked ugly,\u201d John Taylor , who oversees $3.5 billion as founder of currency hedge fund FX Concepts LLC in New York, said in an phone interview on June 19. The real and ruble will suffer \u201cfairly decent\u201d declines later this year as a global recession spurs investors to buy dollars as a haven, Taylor said.\nAfter spending most of last year introducing policies to weaken their currencies, emerging-market governments are now working to limit the slide amid capital outflows.\nBrazil\u2019s government pared a tax on overseas loans on June 14 and has used swaps to add dollars to the market. Russia\u2019s central bank sold U.S. currency this month to slow the ruble\u2019s retreat, according to Chairman Sergey Ignatiev. India cut the amount of overseas income companies can hold in foreign exchange last month, spurring them to repatriate earnings. The ownership ceiling on government bonds was raised by $5 billion to $20 billion, the central bank said in an e-mailed statement today.\nInvestors withdrew $6.3 billion from Brazil\u2019s stocks and bonds in May, the most since at least 2010, central bank data show. Russian capital outflows reached a net $46.5 billion in the first five months of the year, including $5.8 billion in May, which is \u201ca lot\u201d for the country, Ignatiev told reporters in St. Petersburg on June 6.\nConsumer Defaults\nDerivatives traders see no sign of a turnaround.\nWagers on a weaker real on Sao Paulo-based BM&FBovespa\u2019s futures exchange rose to $4.7 billion on June 12, the most since February 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nOption traders are the most bearish on the ruble since October and they expect price swings in the rupee to be the biggest in Asia, the data show. Twelve-month forward contracts on the yuan are pricing in a further decline of 0.9 percent in a year.\nA surge in bad loans in Brazil will weaken the real further, said Amit Rajpal, who manages global financial funds for London-based Marshall Wace LLP. The default rate on consumer debt rose to 7.6 percent in April, matching the highest level since December 2009, as lending growth slowed to 18 percent from a record 34 percent in September 2008, according to the central bank .\nIndia Deficit\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ll see now is basically a full-blown credit problem,\u201d said Rajpal, who predicts rising defaults in Brazil will resemble the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market five years ago.\nIn India, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is grappling with trade and budget deficits, corruption scandals and fighting in the ruling coalition. The country may become the first among the BRIC nations to lose its investment-grade rating, Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch Ratings said this month. India\u2019s budget gap amounted to 5.8 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 4.2 percent in Portugal and 3.9 percent in Italy, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nChina has cut its growth target this year to 7.5 percent, from the 8 percent goal that had been in place since 2005. Home values fell in a record 54 of 70 cities tracked by the government in May, while industrial production growth slowed to a three-year low in April.\nIn Russia, the price of Urals crude , the country\u2019s main export blend, sank 26 percent this quarter. Russia relies on oil and gas for about 50 percent of its budget revenue.\nInvestors are still too bullish on assets in the BRIC nations as Europe\u2019s debt crisis weighs on emerging economies, said Eric Fine , a money manager at Van Eck Global.\n\u201cThey will do poorly when the world is doing poorly,\u201d Fine, whose firm oversees about $35 billion, said in a phone interview from New York. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in decoupling.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Ye Xie in New York at yxie6@bloomberg.net ; Michael Patterson in London at mpatterson10@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Laura Zelenko at lzelenko@bloomberg.net ; Dave Liedtka at dliedtka@bloomberg.net\nBRICs Biggest Currency Depreciation Since 1998 to Worsen\nNelson Ching/Bloomberg\nDilma Rousseff, Brazil's president, at a joint news conference in Sanya, Hainan province, China.\nDilma Rousseff, Brazil's president, at a joint news conference in Sanya, Hainan province, China.

Fibria and Suzano are raising a combined $1.5 billion in stock sales this quarter to reduce debt as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) forecasts average pulp prices will drop 5 percent this year.\n\u201cOn the demand side, the scenario is gloomy as exports from Brazil drop and there are no concrete signs of a recovery in Europe,\u201d Daniella Maia, an equity analyst at Ativa Corretora, who has a hold recommendation for both stocks, said by telephone from Rio de Janeiro . \u201cThe outlook is negative for pulp prices this year and next.\u201d\nSao Paulo-based Fibria, the world\u2019s largest pulp producer, rose 4.5 percent to 14.21 reais at 11:05 a.m. in Sao Paulo and was up 2.4 percent for the year. Suzano, based in Salvador , Brazil, climbed 4.8 percent to 4.82 reais, paring its decline this year to 29 percent. Klabin SA (KLBN4) , the country\u2019s biggest paper maker, increased 0.7 percent to 8.98 reais, extending its gain this year to 12 percent. Brazil\u2019s benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 1.3 percent and was up 0.2 percent for the year.\nOfficials at Fibria and Suzano, who can\u2019t be named because of company policy, declined to comment. An official at an outside firm representing Klabin declined to comment.\nChinese Growth\nFibria derives 91 percent of its sales from exports and Suzano 53 percent. They sell mainly to China and Europe, which buy a combined 70 percent of Brazil\u2019s pulp.\nChina may grow at the slowest pace in 13 years, Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) said June 14. The European Union is set to contract 0.4 percent this year as the debt crisis in the 17- nation euro economy worsens, Fitch Ratings said last week.\nKlabin, which focuses on processing pulp into paper for the Brazilian market instead of exporting the raw material, had its average profit estimate quadrupled by analysts in the past three months to 8 centavos. The Sao Paulo-based company has benefited from growing demand in Brazil, the world\u2019s second-largest emerging economy, after more than 35 million people were pulled out of poverty in the past decade.\nPulp exports from Brazil fell 4.7 percent in May from a year earlier and are down 0.3 percent this year through May, according to the Trade Ministry.\nPulp Prices\nThe average annual pulp price will drop for a second year as demand weakens, Goldman Sachs analyst Marcelo Aguiar said in a May 21 report. The average for this year will fall to $771 per metric ton from $812 last year and $848 in 2010. Aguiar declined to comment for this story.\nThe BHKP Global Pulp Price Index , which slumped 23 percent last year, has rebounded 21 percent this year after paper makers built up stockpiles in past months.\nThe rise is unsustainable as producers increase supply amid slowing consumption growth in China and declining sales in Europe, according to Banco Santander SA. (SAN) Prices measured by the index probably will slide 6.2 percent to $737.5 per ton at the end of this year from $786.03 last week, Santander analyst Rodrigo Ordonez said by telephone yesterday from Santiago.\n\u201cThe slowdown in China and the European crisis seem to reflect on the pulp market,\u201d Maia said. \u201cA cycle of capacity increase starts at the end of this year.\u201d\nFour plants are scheduled to start producing a combined 4.8 million metric tons of pulp between this year and next.\nNew Capacity\nInternational Paper Co. (IP) is slated to add 490,000 tons of capacity at a plant in Russia as early as this year. Eldorado Celulose & Papel SA will start a 1.5 million-ton unit in Brazil in (EWZ) November, while Suzano is expanding output in the country by 1.5 million tons in 2013. Stora Enso Oyj (STEAV) and Celulosa Arauco & Constitucion SA will add 1.3 million tons in Uruguay next year.\nFibria and Suzano are raising funds in share sales after debt ballooned in past years. Fibria sold 1.44 billion reais ($768 million) of stock in April and Suzano is raising about 1.45 billion reais in an offering to be priced June 27.\nThe cash will help the two companies weather declining prices, Barbara Mattos, an analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service said in a June 5 telephone interview from Sao Paulo.\n\u201cThe timing of Suzano\u2019s and Fibria\u2019s share sales couldn\u2019t be better,\u201d Mattos said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice financial cushion if you consider that pulp prices aren\u2019t going to help them generate enough cash to support debt reduction and future investments.\u201d\nRising Debt\nSuzano\u2019s net debt jumped to a nine-year high of 4.8 times earnings before items at the end of the first quarter, while Fibria\u2019s ratio reached a two-year high of 4.6, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nFibria posted a loss of 11.2 million reais in the first quarter, compared with a 387 million-real profit a year earlier. Suzano\u2019s net income dropped 50 percent to 71.8 million reais, the data show.\nAverage prices for Brazilian pulp sold in Asia slumped 18 percent from a year earlier in the first quarter to $613.3 per ton, Fibria said on May 14.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a major improvement in prices coming in the short term,\u201d Ativa\u2019s Maia said. \u201cThe pulp market has seen better days.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Lucia Kassai in Sao Paulo at lkassai@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Dale Crofts at dcrofts@bloomberg.net\nFibria, Suzano Cut Most as Pulp Exports Falter\nRich Press/Bloomberg\nBails of cellulose, the raw material for paper products, are stacked for export at the Fibria Celulose SA plant in Aracruz, Espirito Santo, Brazil.\nBails of cellulose, the raw material for paper products, are stacked for export at the Fibria Celulose SA plant in Aracruz, Espirito Santo, Brazil.

The Sao Paulo-based company, which owns 33 percent of Cimpor, disclosed the offer in a March 30 filing to the Portuguese securities regulator.\nVotorantim, which also competes with Cimpor in the Brazilian market for cement, is considering exercising its right of first refusal to buy a 9.6 percent stake from Portugal \u2019s state-owned lender Caixa Geral de Depositos SA , the two people said.

The company said as recently as May it would trim about 1,200 positions from a workforce of about 20,500. Gol expects to end 2012 with 138 planes, down from 150 to start the year.\nA slowdown in economic growth, declines in the currency and an inability to raise prices amid increasing competition fueled losses at the airline in three of the past four quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gol more than doubled capacity in the past five years as growth surged in Latin America \u2019s largest economy.\nThe company will \u201cmost likely\u201d end the year with fewer than 18,000 workers, Pereira said. \u201cThat\u2019s a result of not hiring people, not opening new positions.

Consumers now finance 54 percent of their purchases at Renner\u2019s 174 stores nationwide with Renner credit cards, he said.\nRenner is doubling down on its bet that its credit card, which is issued under the Visa and MasterCard brands and can be used anywhere, will fuel sales by shoppers while also allowing it to profit from real interest rates that are the second highest among G-20 nations. The Porto Alegre , Brazil-based retailer expects national delinquency rates, which hit a 30- month high in May, to stabilize or fall in coming quarters, Santos said in an interview at Bloomberg\u2019s Sao Paulo office.\n\u201cThe worst is over,\u201d he said. \u201cCompared to last year, delinquency numbers should stay stable or get better -- we don\u2019t see them getting worse.\u201d\nDelinquency at Renner\u2019s credit business, which Renner manages on its own without any partnerships with banks, rose to 3.9 percent from 3.5 percent a year earlier.\nRetail Pickup\n\u201cFor years, electronic retailers in Brazil have made as much profit from consumer credit as from sales of their products because interest rates in Brazil have always been so high,\u201d Ricardo Correa, an analyst at Ativa Corretora, said in a phone interview from Rio de Janeiro . \u201cIt\u2019s only natural that clothing and other retailers will want to follow this trend.\u201d\nLojas Renner declined 2.3 percent to 64.80 reais at 12:02 p.m. in Sao Paulo . A close at that price would be the lowest since Aug. 14. The benchmark Bovespa index was little changed.\nGovernment measures to cut interest rates, reduce taxes and ease reserve requirements are helping to ignite a recovery in Brazil, the world\u2019s largest developing economy after China . Outstanding credit expanded 18 percent in June to 2.2 trillion reais ($1.1 trillion).\nBrazilian retail sales unexpectedly rose 1.5 percent in June from the previous month, according to an Aug. 16 government report. An economic activity index calculated by the central bank grew 0.75 percent in June, more than the 0.6 percent increase expected by economists in a Bloomberg survey.\nThe June data suggest that growth is picking up after the government cut taxes on cars and home appliances and the central bank lowered the benchmark rate to a record low of 8 percent. Brazil is forecast to grow 1.9 percent this year, less than China, Russia and India .\nSoured Loans\nItau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) and Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) , Brazil\u2019s two biggest banks by market value, both boosted provisions for soured loans this year as a pickup in inflation and slower economic growth eroded customers\u2019 ability to make payments on time. In September, Itau Chief Executive Officer Roberto Setubal said that the problem of late payments was \u201cpretty much under control\u201d and would start to improve in 2012.\nRenner has gained 37 percent in Sao Paulo trading so far this year, while the MSCI Brazil (MXBR) Consumer Discretionary Index has advanced 1.6 percent. The MSCI Brazil index has declined 5.2 percent. Renner trades at about 26 times annual earnings, compared with 36 for Marisa Lojas SA (AMAR3) , 18 for Guararapes Confeccoes SA (GUAR4) , which runs Riachuelo stores, and 21 for Cia. Hering (HGTX3) , according to Bloomberg data.\n\u2018Risky Business\u2019\nRenner shares, which declined 2 percent to 66.31 reais yesterday, are trading at the closest to analysts\u2019 12-month target price among retailers on the Bovespa index.\nWhile Joao Pedro Brugger, a portfolio manager at Leme Investimentos, which holds Renner shares, sees additional room for Renner to rise, he said continued consumer indebtedness could hurt profit.\n\u201cThe company is adding a risky business that\u2019s not its main business, which could impact its financial results if defaults increase,\u201d he said in a telephone interview from Florianopolis, Brazil.\nRenner had 207 stores in June, including 33 Camicado locations, according to its second-quarter presentation. The company aims to boost that figure to 408 Renner and 125 Camicado stores by 2021, Santos said.\nThe company is investing 220 million reais from 2011 through 2015 to add a third distribution center in Rio de Janeiro and expand two others in Sao Paulo and Santa Catarina states. The investment will allow Renner to use more space in stores to display products for sale rather than storage and will give the company more flexibility to manage fashion collections depending on weather changes, Santos said.\n\u2018More Efficient\u2019\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be more efficient inside our stores,\u201d he said in the Aug. 21 interview. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to reduce the amount of merchandise that is left over from season collections or shortages, which are the No. 1 enemy of the retail industry.\u201d\nRenner\u2019s second-quarter adjusted profit of 103.5 million reais missed analysts\u2019 estimates of 110.4 million reais in a Bloomberg survey.\nOther Brazilian retailers are also counting on growing credit-card sales to fuel profit, including Marisa and Guararapes\u2019s Riachuelo.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an asset with considerable value,\u201d Caue Pinheiro, an analyst at SLW Corretora, said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Felipe Frisch in Sao Paulo at ffrisch1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jessica Brice at jbrice1@bloomberg.net ; Helder Marinho at hmarinho@bloomberg.net\nA Woman Exits A Renner Clothing Store\nPaulo Fridman/Bloomberg\nLojas Renner SA, Brazil\u2019s biggest clothing retailer, is joining the ranks of companies relying on credit cards to fuel profit growth as consumer spending surges.\nLojas Renner SA, Brazil\u2019s biggest clothing retailer, is joining the ranks of companies relying on credit cards to fuel profit growth as consumer spending surges.

The transaction follows Hypermarcas\u2019s move in July to fully redeem 200 million reais of local bonds that paid 113.72 percent of the interbank rate , known as the CDI.

That\u2019s the best performance this year on the benchmark Bovespa index, which is up 3.8 percent.\nThe company is now focused on organic growth and absorbing recent acquisitions, as well as boosting cash flow , he said.

That follows a 62 percent plunge in 2011, when Hypermarcas was the fourth-worst drop on the index.\nInvestors are rewarding the Sao Paulo-based company after it shed 445 million reais ($217 million) of food and hygiene assets and expanded its more profitable beauty and pharmaceuticals businesses. Consumers in Brazil , birthplace to supermodels Gisele Bundchen and Adriana Lima, spent $43 billion on personal care and beauty products in 2011, making it the world\u2019s biggest market after the U.S. and Japan, according to London-based researcher Euromonitor International Ltd. Drug sales in Brazil may climb as much as 74 percent to $52 billion in 2016, according to IMS Health Inc.\n\u201cFocusing on pharmaceuticals, beauty, was an intelligent strategy, especially because margins are higher,\u201d Joao Pedro Brugger, who helps manage 220 million reais at Leme Investimentos in Florianopolis, Brazil, said by telephone on Aug 28. Previously, \u201cthe company had a more aggressive strategy, making acquisitions and expanding in different sectors, which ended up undermining operations and cash-flow generation.\u201d\nPharmaceutical Spending\nHypermarcas is counting on its drug and beauty divisions to fuel sales growth, said Sandra Peres, an analyst at Sao Paulo- based brokerage Coinvalores Corretora de Valores. The company, which makes more than 190 consumer products, including Finn artificial sweeteners, Jontex condoms and generic ibuprofen, will post a 15 percent gain in sales to 3.83 billion reais this year, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. In 2011, revenue climbed 5 percent, missing analysts\u2019 estimates.\nIn December, Hypermarcas sold the Salsaretti, Puropure and Etti food brands to Bunge Ltd. (BG) , and the Perfex, Cross Hatch and the Assolan cleaning brands to Quimica Amparo. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect new assets sale,\u201d  Chief Financial Officer Martim Mattos said in an e-mailed response to questions.\n\u201cThe company considers the medicine and beauty & personal hygiene markets to be the most attractive given the prospects for profit and growth because of demographics such as the expanding middle class, increasing average incomes, low unemployment and an aging population,\u201d he said.\nBrazilians spent $29.9 billion on pharmaceuticals in 2011, according to IMS Health. Over-the-counter and prescription drugs accounted for 56 percent of Hypermarcas\u2019s 957 million reais in net revenue in the second quarter, up from 52 percent a year earlier.\nHighest Valuation\nHypermarcas said on Aug. 10 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 20 percent to 230.4 million reais, topping the 201.1 million-real median estimate of eight analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The company\u2019s loss excluding some items was bigger than analysts expected after the weaker real boosted foreign debt costs.\nThe stock trades at 37 times its estimated earnings for this year, the highest valuation of Bovespa index members. Hypermarcas is also close to its 12-month target price of 13.39 reais per share, the average of 13 estimates compiled by Bloomberg, indicating there isn\u2019t much room for it to rally further, said Caue Pinheiro, an analyst at SLW Corretora.\nHypermarcas fell 0.7 percent to 13.36 reais at 11:32 a.m in Sao Paulo trading.\n\u201cThis year, the price is already very near its limit,\u201d Pinheiro said yesterday in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo.\nLeme Investimentos sold all its Hypermarcas stock earlier this year to profit from the share surge, Brugger said.\nLong-Term Outlook\n\u201cWe prefer other stocks in the consumer sector, but Hypermarcas gives an interesting exposure if you consider a longer term,\u201d he said, adding that the stock could rise to 20 reais a share, without providing a time frame.\nAfter spending $4.9 billion on 21 acquisitions in the past 10 years, the most among Brazilian consumer-goods companies, Hypermarcas is now focused on organic growth, as well as boosting cash flow and reducing debt, Chief Executive Officer Claudio Bergamo dos Santos said on the company\u2019s Aug. 13 second- quarter earnings conference call.\n\u201cAll the restructuring process is turning out well now,\u201d Peres at Coinvalores said by phone on Aug. 28. \u201cThe company is selling more and at better prices while reducing expenses and costs.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Katerina Petroff in Sao Paulo at kpetroff@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jessica Brice at jbrice1@bloomberg.net ; Helder Marinho at hmarinho@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:48:46", "post_time": "2012-08-30 10:38:11", "author": "Katerina Petroff", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-30/hypermarcas-turns-up-bovespa-by-making-people-beautiful.html", "title": "Hypermarcas Turns Up Bovespa by Making People Beautiful", "post_date": "2012-08-30", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "89494094620bfef4dc0319d7ba8f4fe64488a7db"}, {"content": "Brazilian Stock Movers: Cosan, Hypermarcas, Klabin, SLC Agricola\nBy Denyse Godoy - 2012-05-31T22:09:31Z\nThe following companies had unusual price changes in Sao Paulo trading.

Expectations that yields will fall further is also pushing the fund to buy local corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, as well as stakes in publicly traded companies large enough to ensure a board seat, Costa said in a May 27 interview at his office in Rio de Janeiro .\n\u201cWe have to look for other assets with higher returns,\u201d said Costa, who oversees 55.6 billion reais ($34.8 billion) in funds for employees of state-controlled oil producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA.

He said at an April 5 event in Sao Paulo that Petros had reduced its holdings of public debt to about 45 percent from 70 percent last year.\nThe fund in January said it bought 4.88 percent of Itausa - Investimentos Itau SA (ITSA4) , the parent company of Brazil\u2019s biggest bank, for 3.1 billion reais. Not including such purchases, Petros is maintaining its equity holdings because the jump in inflation limits potential stock market gains this year, Costa said. Annual inflation was 6.51 percent in the 12 months through mid-May, the fastest pace since 2005.\nPetros may seek to make private-equity investments in health, education and technology companies, which will benefit from Brazil\u2019s rising wages and falling unemployment, Costa said.

Gerdau SA , Latin America\u2019s largest steelmaker, fell the most in a week as U.S. manufacturing date dimmed the outlook for steel demand. Light SA , Brazil\u2019s second-biggest electricity distributor, led declines among utilities on speculation slowing inflation may diminish the potential for price increases.\nThe Bovespa dropped 0.9 percent 67,054.25 at 11:07 a.m. New York time. Fifty-three stocks declined on the measure while 11 gained. The real weakened 0.6 percent to 1.7637 per dollar.\n\u201cEveryone is keeping a cautious outlook on Petrobras,\u201d said Eduardo Favrin , who oversees about $2.5 billion as head of equities for HSBC Global Asset Management\u2019s Brazil unit in Sao Paulo. \u201cYou have a lot of unofficial information, but if the offering really is delayed, it\u2019ll bad for the market because that uncertainty continues.\u201d\nPetrobras Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli , President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Finance Minister Guido Mantega and Energy Minister Marcio Zimmermann failed to reach an agreement yesterday on when to hold the company\u2019s planned stock offering, Valor reported, without saying how it got the information. Elections in October and the earnings release period in November will likely lead the company to hold the sale next year if a date is not set for next month, Valor said.\nSeparately, O Estado de S. Paulo reported that Brazil\u2019s government may price reserves in a planned oil-for- stock swap at a price higher than Petrobras is seeking.\nValuations\nThe Brazilian government may price so-called pre-salt crude reserves in a planned swap at $10 to $12 per barrel, while Petrobras seeks to pay $5 to $6 per barrel, daily Estado reported, without saying how it got the information. Gaffney, Cline & Associates, a consulting company hired by the National Petroleum Regulator, will deliver its final report on the price of the reserves today, the newspaper said.\nIn the U.S., jobless claims unexpectedly increased to the highest level since November and an index of Philadelphia-area manufacturing fell.\nInitial jobless claims rose by 12,000 to 500,000 in the week ended Aug. 14, above economists\u2019 estimates of 478,000. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\u2019s general economic index dropped to minus 7.7 in August from 5.1 in July, signaling the manufacturing rebound is slowing. Economists forecast the measure would rise to 7, according to the median of 58 projections in a Bloomberg News survey.\nRate Futures\nPetrobras slid 1.8 percent to 27.18 reais, the lowest price in a month. Gerdau fell the most in a week, dropping 1.8 percent to 24.23 reais.\nLight declined 1.7 percent to 21.78 reais. Yields on Brazil\u2019s interest-rate futures contracts fell to a four-month low amid speculation third-quarter inflation will drop below the central bank\u2019s forecast, reducing the need to raise borrowing costs.

Itau\u2019s parent company will also buy 56.5 million common shares in the lender from Bank of America. The transaction\u2019s total value is about $4.4 billion, said Bank of America spokesman Jerry Dubrowski .\nChief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan pledged at Bank of America\u2019s April annual meeting that the lender would preserve capital to avoid future government bailouts. The sale will give Bank of America, the largest U.S. lender by assets, funds as it adds employees and services at existing overseas operations including Merrill Lynch & Co., acquired in January 2009.\n\u201cThey are adequately capitalized in terms of survivability, but in a very distressed environment it\u2019s another question if investors would view it as a safe haven,\u201d said Sean Ryan , an analyst at Jesup & Lamont Capital Markets in New York. \u201cIf you believe the recovery is taking hold and gathering steam, then there isn\u2019t too much pressure on them.\u201d\nBank of America of Charlotte, North Carolina, gained 13 cents to $16.08 at 10:47 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Itau common shares lost as much as 6.8 percent, the biggest drop in a year, in Sao Paulo trading.\n$1.2 Billion Short\nBank of America repaid $45 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program funds in December after raising more than $19 billion in the largest share sale by a U.S. company since at least 2000. As part of the repayment, the lender pledged to sell assets to produce a net gain of $3 billion by June 30.\nThe cost of Bank of America\u2019s investment in Itau Unibanco was $2.6 billion as of March 31, according to a regulatory filing. That would leave the bank with a $1.8 billion gain, about $1.2 billion short of the $3 billion pledge, said Jaime Peters , an analyst at Morningstar Research.\nBank of America is reviewing other potential asset sales, Dubrowski said, declining to specify. The April sale of its Columbia mutual funds to Ameriprise Financial Inc. isn\u2019t likely to produce a substantial gain, Peters said.\nThe fair market value of Bank of America\u2019s 11 percent stake in China Construction Bank exceeded its cost by more than $11 billion as of March 31, while its 34 percent holding in BlackRock Inc. was $4.1 billion above the cost, according to the regulatory filing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt they can raise the additional money,\u201d Peters said.\nBond Sale\nThe preferred shares would be valued at 6.59 billion reais ($3.62 billion) based on Itau\u2019s closing price yesterday of 34.99 reais. Itausa - Investimentos Itau SA, Sao Paulo-based Itau\u2019s parent company, said it will sell 1.4 billion reais in local bonds to pay for the common stock.\nBank of America acquired 7.4 percent of Banco Itau Holding Financeira SA in 2006 after agreeing to sell to the Brazilian bank its units in Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. The secondary offering of the Itau preferred shares may be concluded in the week of May 31, Itau and Itausa said in the statement.\nThe sale doesn\u2019t reflect any concerns over Brazil\u2019s economy, Dubrowski said. \u201cWe determined it was a noncore asset,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the acquisition of Merrill Lynch we have a significant presence in Latin America and Brazil and this doesn\u2019t change that.\u201d\nGuilherme Magalhaes , a spokesman for Itau in S\u00e3o Paulo, declined to comment on the transaction, via an e-mailed statement.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Helder Marinho in Rio de Janeiro at hmarinho@bloomberg.net ; David Mildenberg in Charlotte at dmildenberg@bloomberg.net .\nBank of America fell 40 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $15.95 today in regular New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

(BLK) has cut its holdings of Vale SA (VALE3) , the world\u2019s largest iron-ore producer, as China\u2019s slowing growth drives down metals prices, fund manager Will Landers said three months after calling the stock the \u201cmost obvious\u201d purchase in Brazil.\n\u201cPrices fell in China faster than we expected,\u201d Landers, who manages about $6 billion in Latin American equities at New York-based BlackRock, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television today. He said he\u2019s sold Vale shares \u201cin the last couple of months\u201d and went to a neutral allocation on the stock in his portfolio from overweight.\nThe move marks a reversal for Landers, who in a May 22 interview said that Vale was the \u201cmost obvious\u201d stock to buy in Brazil because declines in the currency were boosting the company\u2019s export revenue. The real has slumped 20 percent in the past 12 months, the biggest selloff among major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.\nVoting shares of Vale, based in Rio de Janeiro, have dropped 12 percent this year, underperforming Brazil\u2019s benchmark Bovespa index, which has gained 3 percent. The stock fell 0.5 percent today to 34.53 reais in Sao Paulo trading.\nRevenue gains from the weaker currency are being offset by a plunge in iron-ore prices overseas. Iron ore fell below $100 for the first time since 2009 on concern that rising stockpiles and the slowdown in China will cut demand for the steel ingredient.\nOre with 62 percent iron content delivered to the Chinese port of Tianjin slumped 4.9 percent to $99.60 a dry ton yesterday, according to a gauge compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. Prices fell to $99.40 a dry ton today and are heading for a fifth monthly drop, taking this year\u2019s loss to 28 percent.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Fabiola Moura in Sao Paulo at fdemoura@bloomberg.net ; Erik Schatzker in New York at eschatzker@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Papadopoulos at papadopoulos@bloomberg.net ; Helder Marinho at hmarinho@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:49:54", "post_time": "2012-08-24 18:17:01", "author": "Fabiola Moura , Erik Schatzker", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-24/blackrock-scraps-obvious-vale-overweight-landers-says-1-.html", "title": "BlackRock Scraps \u2018Obvious\u2019 Vale Overweight, Landers Says", "post_date": "2012-08-24", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "8493fe77cdb596799cd01f5e94eb497ed0faf9f9"}, {"content": "JBS Profit at Four-Year High on Grass-Fed Beef: Corporate Brazil\nBy Rodrigo Orihuela and Lucia Kassai - 2012-10-01T13:55:35Z\nJBS SA (JBSS3) , the world\u2019s largest beef producer, is set to post the highest quarterly profit since 2008 as Brazilian meatpackers are shielded from surging grain and cattle prices that eroded the margins of global peers.\nThird-quarter net income will be 331.8 million reais ($164 million), compared with a year-earlier loss of 67.5 million, according to the average of four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. JBS\u2019s 19 percent return in the past three months makes it the world\u2019s third-best performing meatpacking stock, after Barretos, Brazil-based Minerva SA and Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3) , which gained 44 percent and 38 percent, respectively.\nGlobal grain and cattle prices are soaring following the worst U.S. drought in 56 years. While U.S. ranchers rely on corn and other grains to feed livestock, Brazil \u2019s herd is mostly grass-fed. Sao Paulo-based JBS also has been shielded from rising cattle costs after Brazilian prices on Aug. 14 fell to the cheapest relative to U.S. prices in five years.\n\u201cBrazil is in a sweet spot for the next 18 months,\u201d Eric Conrads, who helps manage $1 billion in stocks at ING Groep NV in New York , said by telephone. \u201cBrazilian cattle are grass-fed so you don\u2019t care about corn.\u201d\nCorn and soybean prices reached records since mid-June amid the U.S. drought. Corn rose to $8.38 a bushel on Aug. 21 from $5.05 on May 11, while soy touched $17.68 a bushel on Sept. 4 from as low as $12.58 on June 1.\nU.S. Earnings\nRising grain prices probably will drive farmers to increase production next year, averting food shortages, Greg Page , chairman and chief executive officer of Cargill Inc, said in a Sept. 24 interview. Cargill dominates the U.S. grain market along with Archer Daniels Midland Co. and Bunge Ltd.\nTyson Foods Inc. (TSN) , the largest U.S. meat processor, will report net income of $160 million for the fiscal quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $97 million a year earlier, according to the average of seven analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Tyson shares have lost 11 percent in the past three months. The company cut its full-year sales and profit forecast amid rising feed costs, it said Aug. 6. Revenue will be $33 billion in the year through September, compared with a previous forecast of $34 billion, the Springdale, Arkansas-based company said.\nAn official for JBS, who requested anonymity citing company policy, declined to comment on the company\u2019s earnings. Quarterly earnings may be released Nov. 14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nBrazilian producers are also benefitting from the real\u2019s 7.9 percent decline against the U.S. dollar this year, which boosts profits from exports and overseas operations in local- currency terms. That has been countered by higher costs for items denominated in U.S. currency.\n\u2018Sluggish\u2019 Demand\n\u201cThe dollar is helping exports, but so what? The world is in a crisis and demand is sluggish,\u201d Caue Pinheiro, an analyst with Sao Paulo-based SLW Corretora, said in a telephone interview. \u201cAlso, the crisis reduces their ability to pass on price increases, especially in the U.S.\u201d\nJBS still needs to deal with its high level of debt, which makes it a less appealing investment than local peer Minerva, Conrads said.\nThe company\u2019s debt ballooned since 2005 as brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, whose father Jose Batista Sobrinho founded JBS in 1953 by opening a slaughterhouse, started to expand outside of Brazil with 16 acquisitions since then, including Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp. (PPC) , Swift & Co. and Tasman Group Services.\nRising Debt\nNet debt was 15.3 billion reais in the second quarter, up 25 percent from a year ago. Debt is at 4.3 times earnings, excluding items, from 3.6 times a year ago.\nThe large debt load is now being addressed by JBS as the need for mergers subsides, said Henrique Koch, an analyst with Banco do Brasil SA.\n\u201cIt seems that JBS pushed back on acquisitions and is focusing on efficiency,\u201d Koch said in a Sept. 27 telephone interview from Sao Paulo. \u201cThat\u2019s good news, they are doing their homework.

Pork supply will drop to the lowest per- capita since 1975 next year, the USDA estimates. Hog futures that fell more than any other commodity since June 30 may surge 41 percent in 12 months to as high as $1.055 a pound, based on the median of 12 analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.\nCrop damage from the worst U.S. drought since 1956 sent corn-feed prices surging to a record last month and may mean losses of about $44 a head for hog farmers in the fourth quarter, the most since 1998, Purdue University estimates. Two producers in Canada filed bankruptcy petitions this month. While the acceleration in slaughtering is boosting supply now, buyers including CKE Inc., the owner of Hardee\u2019s and Carl\u2019s Jr. fast- food chains, expect higher prices in 2013 as herds shrink and U.S. exports rise.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see more consolidation in the industry,\u201d said Mark Greenwood , who oversees $1.4 billion of loans and leases to the hog business as a vice president at AgStar Financial Services Inc. in Mankato, Minnesota. \u201cIt\u2019s only going to get worse on the higher feed prices.\u201d\nWorst Commodity\nFutures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange fell 21 percent since June 30, the biggest drop among 24 commodities tracked by the Standard & Poor\u2019s GSCI Spot Index (MXWD) , which rose 9.9 percent. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities gained 7.3 percent this quarter and Treasuries returned 0.2 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.\nA pig eats 10 bushels of corn to reach a slaughter weight of about 270 pounds (122 kilograms), the University of Missouri at Columbia estimates. Corn futures rose 47 percent since mid- June after the USDA predicted the drought will cut domestic output by 13 percent. Prices reached a record $8.49 a bushel in Chicago on Aug. 10.\nProducers may receive about $56 per hundredweight for hogs in the fourth quarter, and the cost of production is estimated at about $72.29 per hundredweight, said Chris Hurt, an agricultural economist at Purdue University in West Lafayette , Indiana . That means farmers may earn about $151.20 for a 270- pound hog that cost about $195.18 to produce.\nSlaughter Rush\nHog farmers will see \u201chuge amounts of red ink\u201d in the fourth quarter, said Jim Robb , the director of the Livestock Marketing Information Center, which is funded by the industry, universities and government. Fewer sows will be kept for breeding, cutting output and tightening pork supply, he said. That will raise both wholesale and retail prices to records by the second half of 2013, Robb said.\nPrices for now are retreating, with wholesale pork costs tracked by the USDA tumbling as much as 25 percent since June 25 to the lowest in almost two years on Sept. 19. Hog slaughtering climbed 2.8 percent in first eight months of the year, the most since 2009, when farmers sought to shrink herds amid weaker demand following the global recession and the outbreak of the H1N1 virus, known as swine flu.\nThe 12 percent drop in corn prices from a record last month, and the prospect of bigger harvests next year, may encourage some hog farmers to slow their herd reduction. Slaughter rates in the five weeks through Sept. 1 rose less than 5 percent from a year earlier. That may leave enough sows to accelerate production once feed costs have come down enough, Rachel J. Johnson, a USDA economist, wrote in a Sept. 18 report.\nCheap Hogs\nMeatpackers processed an estimated 79.735 million hogs in this year through Sept. 22, 2 percent more than a year earlier, government data show. Animals sold at slaughterhouses fell to 63.58 cents a pound on Sept. 14, the lowest since Nov. 26, 2010. Prices retreated 9 percent this year.\nLean-hog futures for July delivery are trading at 97.3 cents a pound, compared with 74.65 cents for this December, a sign traders are already anticipating fewer supplies next year. Per-capita pork supplies will shrink to 45.2 pounds next year, the lowest since 1975, the USDA estimates.\nU.S. hog producers are retaining fewer gilts, or young females that haven\u2019t had a litter yet, reducing the number available to replace older sows, said Rich Nelson , the chief strategist at Allendale Inc. in McHenry, Illinois , who has tracked the market for about 15 years.\nCheaper Meat\nEven with higher prices, pork will remain cheaper than beef, said John Nalivka, the president of Sterling Marketing Inc., an agricultural economic research and advisory company in Vale , Oregon . Wholesale pork fell 8 percent to 78.34 cents a pound this year, as beef declined 1 percent to $1.9269 a pound, USDA data show.\n\u201cIf you got sticker shock on pork, you\u2019ll have a heart attack when you look at beef,\u201d C. Larry Pope, the chief executive officer of Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD) , the world\u2019s biggest pork processor, said on a conference call with analysts Sept. 4.\nThe price gap between hog and cattle futures was the widest in more than 26 years on Sept. 12, signaling consumers may switch to pork over beef. Rising U.S. pork exports may also spur a rebound in prices, according to Purdue\u2019s Hurt.\nU.S. exporters shipped 3.14 billion pounds (1.43 million metric tons) in the first seven months of this year, 11 percent more than a year earlier, USDA data show. Exports will expand to 5.35 billion pounds next year, from an estimated 5.346 billion in 2012, the government forecasts.\nFood Costs\nRising pork prices will boost costs for restaurants and grocery stores. Consumers may pay as much as 3 percent more for pork this year and as much as 3.5 percent more in 2013, the government projects.\nCKE, based in Carpinteria, California , has lower pork costs now because of the higher slaughter rate, according to CEO Andrew Puzder . Pork and beef prices probably will rise next year and the chain may offer more chicken instead, he said.\nCracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc. (CBRL) \u2019s meat costs are rising because of feed prices, CEO Sandra Cochran said by phone. The chain, which operates more than 600 restaurants across 42 states, will probably pay about 5 percent to 6 percent more for its food commodities in its fiscal year ending in July, Chief Financial Officer Lawrence Hyatt said on a conference call with analysts Sept. 19. The chain, based in Lebanon, Tennessee , is raising menu prices about 2 percent in fiscal 2013.\nBob Evans Farms Inc., the Columbus, Ohio-based restaurant chain, has seen a drop in sow costs as herds are liquidated, and expects prices to stay low until the culling stops, CFO Paul DeSantis said on a conference call with analysts Aug. 15. Once that is over, \u201cprices tend to increase very rapidly,\u201d he said.\nPork Development\nBig Sky Farms, the second-largest hog producer in Canada , went into receivership this month partly because of rising feed costs, said Neil Ketilson, the general manager of the Saskatchewan Pork Development Board. The company produces more than 1 million pigs a year, according to its website . Puratone Corp. sought protection from creditors on Sept. 12. The Niverville, Manitoba-based company markets more than 500,000 hogs per year, according to its website .\nBrad Hennen, a hog producer in southwest Minnesota, is reducing the size of his business because costlier feed and declining prices for weaned pigs. While he generally markets as many as 15,000 pigs annually, he expects to sell no more than 6,000 this year.\n\u201cIt could easily get worse than that,\u201d said Hennen, who has been raising hogs since 1987 and is based about 3.5 miles northeast of Ghent, Minnesota . \u201cWhat can I do now to minimize my losses and still have a business for when the cash starts flowing again?\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Elizabeth Campbell in Chicago at ecampbell14@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Steve Stroth at sstroth@bloomberg.net\nPork Supply Shrinks to Lowest Since 1975 on Drought\nDaniel Acker/Bloomberg\nCrop damage from the worst U.S. drought since 1956 sent corn-feed prices surging to a record last month and may mean losses of about $44 a head for hog farmers in the fourth quarter, the most since 1998, Purdue University estimates.\nCrop damage from the worst U.S. drought since 1956 sent corn-feed prices surging to a record last month and may mean losses of about $44 a head for hog farmers in the fourth quarter, the most since 1998, Purdue University estimates.

Scott Beason, center, talks with tomato farmers about the Alabama immigration law in Steele, Ala.\nEsene Manga, an Eritrean refugee living in Atlanta, hadn\u2019t heard of Albertville, Alabama until a recruiter offered him a job there. Now Manga, 22, earns $10.85 an hour cutting chicken breasts on a poultry-plant night shift, an unexpected beneficiary of a year-old law designed to drive out illegal Hispanic immigrants.\nThis isn\u2019t what the law\u2019s backers said would happen. Republican state Senator Scott Beason, a sponsor, said at a news conference last year that the restrictions on undocumented workers would \u201cput thousands of native Alabamians back in the work force.\u201d\nInstead, it caused a labor shortage that resulted in the importation of hundreds of legal African and Haitian refugees, and Puerto Ricans, according to interviews with workers, advocacy organizations and businesses. Most were recruited by the poultry industry, in a segment of the economy that has been a heavy employer of undocumented workers, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, a Washington research group.\nAlabama is one of five states that last year passed immigration laws modeled on a 2010 Arizona measure largely invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court in June. Last month, an appellate court in Atlanta said many of the Alabama law\u2019s requirements also aren\u2019t constitutional. Other provisions, including one allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants, remain in place.\nDestination: Albertville\nIn Albertville, a city of about 21,000 in the northeast corner of the state, Manga, his friend Abrahaley Araya and about 18 other African refugees started at Wayne Farms LLC\u2019s plant in the days after the law took effect a year ago, according to the two men and Albert Mbanfu of Lutheran Services of Georgia , which helps refugees find jobs.\nJohnell Rodriguez, 26, said he was among 17 Puerto Ricans who arrived at another Alabama Wayne Farms plant a week after the law took effect. Haitian Saul Jules said he was recruited in Miami to work in Albertville by JBS SA (JBSS3) \u2019s Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp. a few months ago.\nPlants sought refugees because too few local residents were interested or qualified, said Frank Singleton, a spokesman for Wayne Farms, based in Oakwood, Georgia.\nMany legal Hispanic employees left after the immigration law took effect, he said. The company, which operates six plants in the state, spent $5 million to replace and train new workers, he said. Turnover in North Alabama was 50 percent last year, and is now as high as 90 percent in some plants because replacements didn\u2019t stay, he said. The company is \u201chaving to use alternative methods and sourcing,\u201d including recruiting refugees, Singleton said.\nAfrica to Alabama\nWayne Farms found Eritreans, displaced by war and conflict, and other Africans through East Coast Labor Solutions LLC, a Fairlea, West Virginia-based labor broker. East Coast has about 200 workers in Alabama, owner Ray Wiley said in an interview.\n\u201cOur jobs are often in states where immigration laws have hit the hardest, and mostly in the poultry industry,\u201d he said.\nEast Coast began calling Atlanta refugee agencies several months ago looking for legal immigrants to come to Alabama for a year, said Mbanfu, refugee employment director for Lutheran Services in Atlanta. He said the company would have taken as many refugees as he could refer.\nThe agency connected East Coast with refugees who had been in the country three to five years, he said.\nFresh Peppers\nChris Gaddis, head of human resources for Greeley, Colorado-based Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, which has four plants in Alabama, said the law didn\u2019t affect its workforce. Worth Sparkman, a spokesman for Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) , which has two plants in Alabama, also said there was no effect.\nAlabama doesn\u2019t track the number of refugees who come to fill jobs. The state had an estimated 120,000 illegal Hispanic immigrants in 2010, of whom 95,000 were in the labor force, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. They were 2.5 percent of the population and 4.2 percent of the workforce.\nChanging demographics are reflected on store shelves. Albertville\u2019s main Hispanic grocery, Tienda El Sol, added coconut milk, new varieties of hot peppers and other items to appeal to newcomers, manager Marjorie Centeno said.\nThe Alabama law\u2019s intent was to attack \u201cevery aspect of an illegal alien\u2019s life,\u201d and \u201cmake it difficult for them to live here so they will deport themselves,\u201d Republican House sponsor Micky Hammon said during legislative debate, according to a Birmingham News report.\nUnwelcome Mat\nThe measure let police arrest people after traffic stops if they couldn\u2019t prove legal status. It made it a crime to rent property to illegal immigrants, forbade registering their cars or giving them dog or business licenses, and required schools to check students\u2019 citizenship.\nBeason, the senator, said that while he welcomes legal immigrants, he isn\u2019t pleased by the arrival of the refugees.\n\u201cWe would prefer they hire native Alabamians,\u201d he said. The reason refugees are being hired is probably because \u201cthey\u2019re cheaper,\u201d he said.\nBeason credits the law with a decrease in Alabama\u2019s unemployment rate . It dropped to 8.5 percent in October 2011 from 8.8 the month before and continued to decline. Unemployment was 8.5 percent in August, the most recent month for which data is available.\nThe drop \u201cabsolutely, directly coincides with when our law went into effect,\u201d he said this month. \u201cIt put thousands of Alabamians into jobs.\u201d\n\u2018Ghost Town\u2019\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that the rate fell because the labor force shrank. Fewer people had jobs in Alabama in August than did before the law.\nIn Albertville, poultry plants had long drawn Hispanic workers. In 2010, the Hispanic population in surrounding Marshall County was about three times the state average, according to the Pew Center.\nThe Pew Center has no estimate on how many Hispanics left Alabama. Anecdotal evidence suggests Albertville lost many.\n\u201cHere, it\u2019s like a ghost town for Hispanics,\u201d said Rafael Leon, owner of Accessories La Alianza, near Albertville. Leon sat waiting for customers to walk in and buy prepaid mobile phones and sparkly butterfly hair clips, skin creams and key chains. Rows of glass cases were empty. He said the store was busy before the law.\n\u201cNow zero,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody\u2019s coming in.\u201d\nHe said he\u2019ll move if business doesn\u2019t pick up by December. Leon said one son is about to go to college, another is in high school and he himself has a baby.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all kind of depressed,\u201d he said.\nCold Comfort\nCenteno, the grocery manager, said she has seen the decline, too. She said poultry companies could have used the money spent to find the refugees to help Hispanics get legal status. She said she has heard from recruits who complain that the plants are too cold and the jobs too difficult.\nJules was one of four Haitians sitting in the Albertville lobby of Alatrade Foods LLC, a chicken-processing company that offers orientation in Creole, hoping for work. Jules said he lost his original job with Pilgrim\u2019s Pride (PPC) after a month.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a lucky person,\u201d he said.\nRodriguez, the Puerto Rican, said he was recruited in a San Juan unemployment office by East Coast. He and 31 others flew to Atlanta the next month for poultry jobs, then split into buses to Alabama and North Carolina , Rodriguez said in Spanish through an interpreter.\nManga and Araya, a 32-year-old who now works for Tyson, found themselves living in a dark apartment in an aging complex rented along with its furniture from the labor broker. It\u2019s sparsely furnished, with mismatched chairs and a yellow sofa.\nWhen asked what they do in their spare time, both laughed.\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Araya said, \u201cwe walk to the library.\u201d\nHe and Manga said working in chicken plants is hard, and pays good money.\n\u201cWe are here to work,\u201d Manga said. \u201cWe go to our jobs and come back.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Margaret Newkirk in Atlanta at mnewkirk@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Stephen Merelman at smerelman@bloomberg.net\n0:27\nSept. 24 (Bloomberg) -- An apartment complex where legal immigrants, recruited to work in a local poultry processing plant, live in Albertville, Alabama, is shown in this video. The refugees live three and four to a unit and each pays $68 a week for rent to the companies who hired them and brought them to Albertville..      Companies are importing legal workers from Africa, Haiti and Puerto Rico after Alabama last year passed a law designed to drive illegal Hispanic immigrants out of the state. The intent of the law was to create jobs for local residents.

Dreibus - 2012-09-11T20:03:40Z\nThe smallest U.S. soybean harvest in nine years will leave inventories in the world\u2019s largest exporting nation at the lowest in four decades.\nU.S. farmers will reap 13 percent less than a year earlier after the worst Midwest drought in 76 years, according to the average of 34 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Reserves will be the lowest since 1973 by March, estimates INTL FCStone Inc., which handled $75 billion of physical commodities in 2011. Futures will advance 18 percent to an all-time high of $20 a bushel in three months, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicts.\nCrop prices surged to records this year as drought parched fields across the U.S., South America and Russia . The U.S. Department of Agriculture cut its forecasts the past two months and the Bloomberg survey indicates the agency will do so again tomorrow, leaving Brazil as the top soybean supplier for the first time. Feed costs are rising for meat producers including Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) , the largest in the U.S., and three United Nations agencies said Sept. 4 that swift action is needed to avert a food crisis.\n\u201cThe U.S. will simply run out of soybeans\u201d for exports on March 1, said Doug Jackson, an FCStone vice president in West Des Moines, Iowa, who has been a grain-industry analyst since 1974. \u201cThe supply situation is unprecedented. The theoretical maximum South American shipping capacity may fall short, leaving world buyers wanting.\u201d\nEight Commodities\nSoybean futures have jumped 41 percent to $17.015 this year on the Chicago Board of Trade, and soybean meal, used in livestock feed, surged 65 percent to $515.90 per 2,000 pounds (0.91 metric ton). The Standard & Poor\u2019s GSCI Agricultural Index of eight commodities advanced 16 percent as corn rose 20 percent and wheat 35 percent. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities gained 10 percent, and a Bank of America Corp. index shows Treasuries returned 2 percent.\nThe USDA forecast Aug. 10 that global soybean production will increase 10 percent to 260.5 million tons in the year that begins Oct. 1, compared with demand of 256.9 million tons. The agency projected a 2.8 percent gain in stockpiles to 53.4 million tons. Prices advanced 4.5 percent since then and research companies including Hamburg-based Oil World reduced their predictions for supply as conditions worsened.\nOnly 32 percent of the U.S. soybean crop was deemed by the USDA to be in good or excellent condition as of Sept. 9, compared with a five-year average of 60 percent. Based on temperature and rainfall in June and July, the Midwest drought is the most severe since 1936, according to T-Storm Weather LLC, a Chicago-based forecaster.\nHedge Funds\nHedge funds and other speculators have increased bets on higher prices 10-fold this year, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.\nThe state of the U.S. crop is critical to global prices because it accounted for an average of 45 percent of all shipments over the past decade, USDA data show. That\u2019s down from 63 percent in the previous 10 years as South American farmers expanded production.\nBrazil will send 38.5 million tons overseas next marketing year, nine times more than in 1993, the USDA said last month. Its output will jump 23 percent to 82 million tons, exceeding the U.S. for the first time, according to Oil World. That compares with U.S. output of 72.4 million tons predicted in the Bloomberg survey.\nRecord Crop\nThe surge in prices is encouraging South American growers to cultivate a record crop that may curb the rally. Combined output in Brazil, Argentina , Paraguay , Bolivia and Uruguay may increase 31 percent to 151.6 million tons when harvesting begins in January, Oil World said in a report Aug. 28.\n\u201cSouth American farmers have plenty of land, soybeans cost less to plant than corn and the record profit potential means every available hectare will go into soybeans,\u201d said Dale Durchholz , the Bloomington, Illinois-based senior analyst for AgriVisor LLC, an adviser to the industry. \u201cThe biggest risk to a sustained rally from record prices is that demand may slow more quickly than people expect.\u201d\nFutures have averaged $14.24 this year, heading for an annual record. Demand contracted 3.7 percent in the 2008-2009 season, the most in a quarter century, after prices jumped 74 percent in 2007 and economies tumbled into the worst recession since World War II. The economy in China , which accounts for 29 percent of consumption, has slowed for six quarters, and the 27- nation Europe Union, mired in a debt crisis, will consume the fewest soybeans since at least 1999, the USDA estimates.\nMeat Demand\nSoybean consumption expanded at almost four times the pace of the world population since 2000, according to USDA and U.S. Census data. Rising incomes across developing nations increased demand for meat, spurring livestock producers to buy more feed as herds and flocks expanded. China will produce 690 million pigs this year, 36 percent more than at the turn of the century, and consume 36 percent more chicken per person, USDA data show.\nEconomic growth is also spurring more demand for vegetable oils used in everything from fried and baked foods to candy and breads. Global consumption of soybean oil will reach a record 42.98 million tons next marketing year, more than twice as much as two decades ago, according to the USDA, which updates its estimates at 8:30 a.m. in Washington tomorrow.\nCargill Outlook\nMeat consumption in China will continue to expand even as its economy slows, according to Cargill Inc., the biggest U.S. agricultural company. The \u201cmega-trend\u201d of rising demand applies across meat, milk and eggs, Christopher Langholz, the president of Cargill Animal Protein China, said in an interview in Singapore on Sept. 3. China\u2019s gross domestic product rose 19- fold in the past two decades, the World Bank estimates.\nU.S. sales of soybeans for delivery after Sept. 1 reached a record 18.08 million tons in the week ended Aug. 30, with China accounting for 65 percent of the cargoes, USDA data show. The U.S. may have to import 540,000 tons this year, the most ever, the agency estimates. That might increase further unless demand is choked off by higher prices, said Bill Gary , the president of Commodity Information Systems Inc. in Oklahoma City, which provides analysis and information to traders.\nWhile the USDA has already cut its forecast for domestic consumption by 16 percent since June, FCStone expects stockpiles to drop by about 50 percent to less than 600 million bushels (16.3 million tons) by March 1 from a year earlier. The USDA estimated last month that the cost of soybeans at the farm would average a record $16 in the next 12 months, compared with $12.45 this season.\nSoybean Meal\nSales of soybean meal for delivery after Oct. 1 rose 81 percent to 1.582 million tons on Aug. 30, compared with 699,684 a year earlier, USDA data show. U.S. processors in July crushed 137.4 million bushels of soybeans, the highest in five years, data from the National Oilseed Processors Association show.\nMeal prices above $550 are \u201cuntenable\u201d because they make feeding animals too expensive, Donald J. Smith, the president and chief executive officer of Tyson (TNS) , told analysts on a conference call Aug. 6. The Springdale, Arkansas-based company will report net income of $600 million this year, down from $750 million in 2011, according to the mean of seven analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Its shares have dropped 22 percent this year.\nJBS Prices\nJBS SA (JBSS3) , the world\u2019s largest beef producer, will raise prices in response to higher feed costs, Chief Executive Officer Wesley Batista told analysts on a conference call Aug. 15. Shares of the Sao Paulo-based company, which has 120,000 employees worldwide, have declined 4.1 percent this year.\nFeedlots lost about $316 a head in July fattening cattle for slaughter, said Ron Plain , a livestock economist at the University of Missouri . U.S. beef output will drop 3.9 percent to 24.575 billion pounds next year, the lowest since 2004, the USDA estimates. Retail prices will rise 5 percent, outpacing other food groups, according to the agency.\n\u201cNobody has seen this kind of global shortage before, and yet there is little evidence that demand has slowed at current prices,\u201d said Mark Schultz , the Minneapolis-based chief analyst at Northstar Commodity Investments Inc., which advises the grain, livestock and renewable fuel industries. \u201cSoybean demand may not slow until we reach $20.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jeff Wilson in Chicago at jwilson29@bloomberg.net ; Tony C.

Dreibus and Elizabeth Campbell - 2012-08-23T20:04:42Z\nThe worst U.S. drought in a half century and record feed prices are spurring farmers to shrink cattle herds to the smallest in two generations, driving beef prices higher.\nBeef output will slump to a nine-year low in 2013 after drought damaged pastures from Missouri to Montana , the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates. The domestic herd is now the smallest since at least 1973, and retail prices reached a record last month, USDA data show. Cattle futures may rise 8.1 percent to an all-time high of $1.35 a pound in Chicago in the next 12 months, said Rich Nelson , the chief strategist at Allendale Inc. who has tracked the market for 15 years.\nFeedlots are losing $300 a head this month fattening cattle for slaughter, after corn surged 61 percent since June 15, University of Missouri data show. JBS (JBSS3) SA, the largest beef producer, fast-food chain Wendy\u2019s Co. (WEN) and Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc. are among those planning price increases. The USDA expects food inflation of as much as 4 percent in 2013, compared with an average of 3 percent since 2004. A United Nations gauge of global food costs jumped 6.2 percent in July.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a huge liquidation off of pastures,\u201d said Walt Hackney, 74, who buys and sells 250,000 cattle a year in Omaha, Nebraska , and has worked in the livestock business for about a half century. \u201cIt\u2019s all due to the drought. There\u2019s no grass for them to graze on.\u201d\nEight Commodities\nAfter rising 12 percent since late April, cattle are now 2.9 percent higher for the year at $1.24925. The Standard & Poor\u2019s GSCI Agriculture Index of eight commodities advanced 18 percent since the start of January, and the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities added 8.3 percent. Treasuries returned 1.8 percent, a Bank of America Corp. Index shows.\nBeef output in the U.S., the world\u2019s largest producer, will drop 3.9 percent to 24.575 billion pounds (11.147 million metric tons) next year, the lowest since 2004, the USDA estimates. The domestic herd across ranches, feedlots and dairies dropped to 97.8 million head on July 1, the smallest for the date in at least 39 years, the latest data show.\nThe domestic price of beef will rise as much as 5 percent next year, more than any other food group including fruits, cereals and dairy products, the USDA estimated on July 25. Pork may increase by 3.5 percent and poultry 4 percent, the agency said. Retail ground-beef averaged $3.085 a pound in July, the highest since at least 1984, and whole chickens were $1.454 a pound last month, the highest in at least 32 years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nEating Corn\nCattle spend 12 to 18 months eating grass before they are sent to feedlots, where they consume mostly corn for five months until they are fat enough for slaughter. The drought has left pastures in the worst condition since at least 1995, with 59 percent rated poor or very poor on Aug. 19, the government estimates. The corn harvest will drop 13 percent this year to 10.779 billion bushels, the USDA said Aug. 10. The grain reached a record $8.49 a bushel in Chicago that day.\nPrices for hay, the third-biggest domestic crop by value, have also surged. This year\u2019s alfalfa harvest will probably be the smallest since 1953, and the price of meal made from the crop was $334 a ton yesterday in Kansas City , Missouri, up from as low as $239 a year earlier, the USDA estimates.\nSlaughter Increases\nA faster slaughter may initially drive prices lower. Almost 3.09 million cows were culled in the first half of the year, compared with a 10-year average of 2.8 million, USDA data show. The figures have \u201cincreased dramatically\u201d since early June because of the drought, the department said in an Aug. 16 report.\nDemand for exports may slow as a strengthening dollar makes shipments from Australia and Brazil more attractive, David Nelson , an analyst at Rabobank International in Chicago, said in an Aug. 13 report. U.S. exports in the first half were 11 percent smaller than a year earlier, government data show.\nU.S. consumption of red meat and poultry will fall below 200 pounds per person next year for the first time since 1990, the USDA predicts . Retail beef reached an all-time high of $4.715 a pound in July, according to the USDA\u2019s composite price, which includes choice beef, other beef and hamburger values. The Iowa Corn Growers Association estimates one bushel of the grain converts to 5.6 pounds of retail beef.\nFewer Calves\nThe expansion in supply probably won\u2019t last long because it will \u201ccurtail the already limited availability of calves this fall,\u201d Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts said in a report last month. The bank anticipates a futures price of $1.15 in three months and $1.30 in 12 months. Prices next year may exceed the Feb. 22 record of $1.315, Rabobank estimates.\n\u201cOur U.S. cow-herd population is low, and there\u2019s not going to be much adding to the herd with the drought going on,\u201d said Henry Beel, 40, who co-owns a 1,200-head cattle business with his brothers near Johnstown, Nebraska. Beel Brothers LLC has reduced its breeding herd by selling heifers to feedlots, which means \u201cthere\u2019s going to be a smaller amount of cattle available to the packing plants\u201d next year, he said.\nThe slide in output may not stop until 2016 or 2017, Rachel J. Johnson, a USDA livestock economist, wrote in an Aug. 16 report. Once the herd starts to expand, it takes more than two years to boost supplies, according to Ron Plain , a livestock economist at the University of Missouri. Calves have a nine- month gestation period and take about 20 months to reach slaughter weight, he said.\nRaising Prices\n\u201cWe expect higher beef cost will be the largest driver\u201d of commodity spending at Dublin, Ohio-based Wendy\u2019s, Stephen E. Hare, the chief financial officer, told analysts in an Aug. 9 earnings conference call. The company, which operates more than 6,500 fast-food restaurants, will \u201cimplement selective price increases\u201d and cut other expenditures, Hare said.\nWesley Batista, the chief executive officer of Sao Paulo- based JBS, said on a conference call Aug. 15 that the company will raise beef prices because of the grain rally, without saying by how much.\nRed Robin (RRGB) , the Greenwood Village , Colorado-based restaurant operator, said on an earnings conference call on Aug. 9 that the chain will be making \u201cmodest\u201d price increases partly because of the outlook for rising commodities and the impact of the drought.\nSteakhouses\nArne Haak, chief financial officer of Ruth\u2019s Hospitality Group Inc., the owner of upscale steakhouses, said on an earnings conference call on July 27 that higher beef costs are hurting the Heathrow, Florida-based company\u2019s bottom line. The company is evaluating \u201cadditional menu engineering and pricing opportunities,\u201d he said.\nFederal Reserve policy makers \u201cacknowledged that the drought would likely result in a temporary run-up in consumer food prices later this year,\u201d according to minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s July 31-Aug. 1 gathering released yesterday.\nExpensive grain also is hurting livestock producers from Asia to Europe. The Korea Feed Association, South Korea\u2019s biggest grain importer, urged the U.S. in July to consider cutting the use of corn and soybeans in biofuel production . The Asian country gets about 80 percent of its feed corn from American growers.\nIn Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest pig producer, farmers lost about 30 euro-cents (38 cents) on every kilogram (2.2 pounds) of pork sold in the first half, said Matthias Quaing, a consultant at farm group Interessengemeinschaft der Schweinehalter Deutschlands. The U.K.\u2019s National Pork Association estimates farmers accounting for 10 percent of the country\u2019s output may leave the business by late December.\n\u2018Losing Money\u2019\n\u201cWe\u2019re losing money on every pig we sell,\u201d said James Hart, a second-generation producer in Cirencester, England , who will sell the last of his pigs in November. \u201cThe problem in the Midwest states and the critical drought is driving our corn prices and our wheat prices around the world to levels we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\nIn the U.S., hog farmers may lose $25 a pig in the fourth quarter, said Scott Brown , an agricultural economist at the University of Missouri in Columbia. Higher feed costs are detrimental to the credit ratings of producers including Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) , Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp. (PPC) and Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD) , Moody\u2019s Investors Service said in a report Aug. 16.\nDan Harris, the owner of the Holton Livestock Exchange in Holton, Kansas, said he is selling twice as many cattle as usual for this time of year. Less than half the normal amount of rain fell in parts of the state during the past 30 days, according to the National Weather Service . Without more moisture, producers will keep shrinking herds, Harris said by phone Aug. 15.\n\u201cPeople are selling their calves 60 to 90 days early to preserve their cow herds,\u201d he said. \u201cConditions will not improve until we get some rain.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Whitney McFerron in London at wmcferron1@bloomberg.net ; Tony C.

Chief Executive Officer Joseph Grendys.\n\u201cCosts have gone up so much due to the drought that the industry will be forced to get price increases of 10 to 15 percent across all product lines\u201d for 2013 over this year, Grendys said in a telephone interview yesterday from Koch\u2019s headquarters in Park Ridge , Illinois .\nThe closely held company, which says it\u2019s the fourth- largest U.S. chicken producer by sales, is starting to talk to customers about 2013 prices. Koch expects to sign one-year supply contracts with clauses allowing for quarterly adjustments according to grain costs, Grendys said. The last time the company sought quarterly adjustments was in 2008, he said.\nThe U.S. chicken industry returned to profitability in January after months of losses amid a supply glut, according to investment bank Stephens Inc. Production has declined in the first half of 2012 and rising feed costs now threaten to erode margins.\nMost-active corn futures in Chicago rose to a record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10 and soybeans reached a record $17.4475 a bushel today as the worst drought in five decades reduced crop yields. U.S. corn yields may be even lower than the 123.4 bushels per acre that the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast on Aug. 10, Grendys said.\nCost Analysis\nWhile demand for Koch\u2019s chicken products is \u201cextremely strong,\u201d uncertainty caused by the drought is leading the company to analyze its sales against the cost of raising chickens, Grendys said. The industry has reduced production costs over the last decade and can\u2019t count on lower input costs in the future, he said.\n\u201cThe industry needs to be smart\u201d and focus on pricing to ensure it remains profitable, he said. Even if it does become unprofitable in the fourth quarter, the industry may resume making money after the first quarter of 2013, he said.\nTyson Foods Inc. (TSN) , the largest U.S. chicken producer, said Aug. 6 that its chicken unit will be profitable in fiscal 2013 based on current grain prices because of operational improvements and cost cuts. Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson has reduced the volume of its poultry under annual fixed-price contracts to less than 15 percent.\nPrices for most of Tyson\u2019s birds are either tied to specific markets or \u201callow for conversations about adjusting prices\u201d to offset higher inputs, Chief Operating Officer Jim Lochner said on a conference call with analysts on Aug. 6.\nJBS SA (JBSS3) \u2019s Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp.

The average adjusted profit estimate of five analysts tracked by Bloomberg was 253.9 million reais.\nEarnings before items represented 5.5 percent of sales, up from 4 percent a year ago, after margins at its Mercosur beef unit improved on lower cattle prices. Cattle prices in Brazil, which accounts for about a quarter of sales, fell 7.2 percent, on average, in the period, the University of Sao Paulo\u2019s Cepea crop-research agency said on its website.\nPilgrim\u2019s Pride (PPC) , the company\u2019s U.S. unit, \u201cshowed a material recovery in profitability,\u201d which translated into better results, Ricardo Boiati, an analyst with Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) , said in a Aug. 7 note to clients. He rates the stock market perform, which means the stock is expected to perform in the range of 10 percent above or below the main Bovespa stock index.\nThe Brazilian real\u2019s 9.1 percent slide against the U.S. dollar in the quarter boosted the value of overseas assets in local currency, which is booked as a gain under the country\u2019s accounting rules.

The first of the farms are required to start operating this month.\nBrazil was the world\u2019s 11th market for the renewable energy last year, Steve Sawyer , secretary general of the Brussels-based industry lobby group Global Wind Energy Council, said in a Feb. 7 interview.\nEurope Projects\nIn an August auction, companies agreed to generate power at an average rate of 99.54 reais, or about $49.31, per megawatt- hour, according to EPE. Wind developers receive about 150 euros ($190) a megawatt hour in Italy , 75 euros in Germany and 74 euros in Spain, Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst Eduardo Tabbush said by telephone from London .\nRenova estimates its turbines will spin more than 50 percent of the time, compared with an average of 25 percent for wind farms in Europe. The gusts that blow westward over the Atlantic across Brazil\u2019s northeast are the most consistent weather system in the world, the American Meteorological Society says, allowing companies to use cheaper and lighter turbines.\nRenova declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.\nBrazil\u2019s drive to become a major producer of wind energy has lured France\u2019s Alstom SA, the U.S.\u2019s General Electric Co. (GE) and India \u2019s Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , which have all built factories to make equipment in Brazil in the past three years.\n\u2018Tight\u2019 Margins\nTurbine makers likely agreed to cut prices for the Brazil auctions after the market for the equipment collapsed in the U.S. and Europe as the debt crisis prompted governments to scale back the size of subsidies for renewable energy projects, Tabbush said.\nEven with the discounts, margins will be \u201cvery tight\u201d on the projects, Tabbush said. A weaker local currency, which makes imported parts and equipment more expensive, may erode margins, he said.\nBrazil\u2019s real has weakened 23 percent against the U.S. dollar in the past 12 months, the worst performer of the 16 most-traded currencies tracked by Bloomberg.\nPacific Hydro Pty., a Melbourne-based developer that\u2019s built two wind farms in the northeastern state of Paraiba, chose not to participate in the auctions on concern the rates being offered were too low.\nUnsustainable Returns\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased we didn\u2019t take part,\u201d said Rob Grant, chief executive officer of Pacific Hydro, which aims to develop wind farms and sell to the free market. \u201cAfter the 2010 auctions, we realized the regulated market wasn\u2019t the place to make sustainable returns.\u201d\nLight SA, a Rio de Janeiro-based utility, bought a 26 percent stake in Renova Energia for 360 million reais last year and agreed to purchase power from 400 megawatts of wind farms on the free electricity market , the companies said in a statement last July.\nRenova expects to raise at least 250 million in a private stock offering to BNDES Participacoes SA, a unit of Brazil\u2019s development bank, to fund current and future projects, according to a June 25 regulatory filing.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what will happen -- maybe there will be problems,\u201d said Garad Hassan\u2019s Aranguren. \u201cWhen you\u2019re bidding, it\u2019s like a gamble, like a game.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Stephan Nielsen in Sao Paulo at snielsen8@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jessica Brice in Sao Paulo at jbrice1@bloomberg.net .\nRenova Strives for World\u2019s Cheapest Wind Power in Brazil\nAdriano Machado/Bloomberg\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:51:16", "post_time": "2012-07-01 23:00:01", "author": "Stephan Nielsen", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-02/renova-strives-for-world-s-cheapest-wind-power-in-brazil-energy.html", "title": "Renova Strives for World\u2019s Cheapest Wind Power in Brazil: Energy", "post_date": "2012-07-01", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "3200605878adc6d4bf7d7674cb8ef5b7bf52ec55"}, {"content": "Brazil Hydro Plant Workers on Strike, Barricade Roads\nBy Mario Sergio Lima - 2012-04-23T17:04:18Z\nWorkers at a hydroelectric power plant under construction in northern Brazil are striking, the group responsible for building the project said in an e-mailed statement today.\nThe group, Norte Energia SA, didn\u2019t say how many people have walked off the job at the Belo Monte plant in Altamira.

Some co- workers have lost teeth in encounters with angry customers.\nTo avoid confrontations with the street toughs who walk around with guns tucked into their trousers, Dourado, 28, practices a studied indifference, Bloomberg Businessweek reports in its March 12 issue. \u201cI just keep on doing what I\u2019m doing until they come speak to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s trouble, I leave.\u201d\nElectricity theft is rampant across much of Latin America , so much so that statisticians have devised a formula that uses the purloined wattage to measure the size of a country\u2019s informal economy. In some parts of Brazil, power losses reach as high as 20 percent.\nTo combat the problem and avoid violent encounters, utilities are turning to smart meters. The devices, which cost about $150 to $400 each, including hardware, communications software and installation, let power companies monitor customers\u2019 usage remotely and in real time.\nThe meters can detect unusually heavy demand, which may signal an illegal hookup. They can also be used to shut off service to households and businesses that don\u2019t pay their bills. The devices remove the human factor from the equation, so customers can no longer collude with dishonest meter readers to cheat the power company.\n\u2018Perfect Solution\u2019\nSmart meters \u201care the perfect solution,\u201d said Fabio de Oliveira Toledo, chief technology officer for the distribution unit of Light SA (LIGT3) , a Rio de Janeiro-based utility that has installed more than 150,000 of them. \u201cThey save you money, they\u2019re easy to install, and they require little maintenance.\u201d\nAndre Pepitone da Nobrega, director of the national electricity regulator, Agencia Nacional de Energia Eletrica , said the meters may save utilities as much as 8 billion reais ($4.5 billion) a year.\nMakers of the wireless gadgets, including Toshiba Corp. (6502) \u2019s Landis + Gyr AG (LGYZ) , Echelon (ELON) Corp. and Elster Group SE (ELT) , are increasingly counting on developing markets to offset shrinking revenue in the U.S., where government funding to support smart meter deployment has dried up.\nSales of smart meters in Latin America are expected to generate $24 billion in revenue through 2020, two-thirds of it in Brazil , according to Northeast Group LLC, a Washington-based research company.\n\u201cLots of U.S. companies are excited about Latin America and Brazil,\u201d said Jeff Lund, vice president of business development at San Jose , California-based Echelon.\nLatin American Demand\nBrazilian utilities may install as many as 63.5 million smart meters by the end of the decade, at a cost of approximately $15.2 billion, according to Northeast Group. The company estimates that Mexico will deploy 22.4 million, Argentina 4.9 million and Chile 3.2 million over the same period.\n\u201cBrazil is a clear regional leader,\u201d in smart grid development, said Ben Gardner, president of Northeast Group. \u201cMexico is next in line.\u201d\nElster, based in Essen, Germany , has retooled its factory in southern Brazil to produce smart meters as well as the regular variety. Hong Kong-based ATC International Group is considering teaming up with a local partner to open a facility in the country by 2013.\n\u201cBrazil will become one of the world\u2019s top five markets,\u201d for smart meters, predicts ATC\u2019s chief executive officer, David Liang.\nMaking Preparations\nIn Rio de Janeiro , utilities are taking advantage of preparations for the 2014 World Cup soccer championship and 2016 Olympic Games to deploy the meters.\nBefore August about 80 percent of electricity in Tabajara and Morro dos Cabritos, two of the city\u2019s more violent slums, was stolen through illegal connections, said Geraldo Guimaraes, vice president for Latin America at Elster\u2019s Integrated Solutions division.\nAfter police established a constant presence in the favelas last year, Light began installing 50,000 of Elster\u2019s meters. Theft has dropped to zero since, Guimaraes said. \u201cNow everyone receives invoices, and if they don\u2019t pay them, they\u2019re disconnected.\u201d\nCompanies like Elster are anticipating a substantial payday. Brazil may require utilities to replace all of the country\u2019s 67 million existing power meters with smart devices under a program expected to be introduced by year-end, said Brazil\u2019s electricity regulator.\nIf that happens, Landis + Gyr will be ready. The company has added three salespeople in Brazil over the past year, said Eduardo Casagrande, South America sales director. \u201cI have no doubt the market will explode,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only question is when.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Stephan Nielsen in Sao Paulo at snielsen8@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Reed Landberg at landberg@bloomberg.net\nPower Theft Driving Demand for Smart Meters\nErich Schlegel/The New York Times/Redux\nA smart electric meter manufactured by Landis + Gyr, installed for home use in the US.

Nissan chose to set up its $1.4 billion unit elsewhere in Rio state, and Anglo delayed by a year the start of its Minas-Rio project, which includes completing an iron-ore terminal at the port.\nThe Acu port project is the centerpiece of Batista\u2019s plan to integrate his commodities and oil empire and tap Chinese demand for raw materials from Brazil . Batista vowed last year to make Acu the world\u2019s third-biggest port by attracting investments from oil-storage facilities to steelworks and car plants.\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to carry out a project like that these days when you have a steel supply surplus?\u201d Pedro Galdi , chief strategist at brokerage SLW Corretora, said by phone from Sao Paulo , referring to the proposed Ternium steel project. \u201cNobody is going to want to set up a mill and then end up with the white elephant.\u201d\nLLX said in an e-mailed response to questions that negotiations with Ternium are in an \u201cadvanced\u201d stage and that about 70 memorandums of understanding have been signed with companies interested in setting up units or move freight through the Acu superport.\nEBX Group Co., the holding company for most of Batista\u2019s assets, referred questions to LLX. A press officer for Ternium in Buenos Aires , who declined to be named because of corporate policy, said the company won\u2019t comment.\nAmericas\u2019 Largest\nBatista, Brazil\u2019s richest man, said in an interview in New York on March 14, 2011, that Acu will become the largest port in the Americas with capacity to handle 350 million metric tons of iron ore, oil, steel and other products annually. Batista was counting on manufacturers such as Luxembourg-based Ternium and Nissan, based in Yokohama, Japan , setting up plants at Acu to transform iron ore and other raw materials into steel, cars and electronics that would then be shipped through the port.\nTernium and Tenaris SA (TEN) , both controlled by the Rocca family\u2019s Techint Group , last year agreed to pay about 5 billion reais ($2.5 billion) for a stake allowing them to join the group that controls Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA , known as Usiminas, Brazil\u2019s second-biggest steelmaker by output.\nLikely Delay\nTernium Chief Financial Officer Pablo Brizzio said Aug. 1 the steelmaker is reevaluating the Acu port project and will likely delay its decision.\n\u201cThe possibility of getting iron ore into this port has been delayed,\u201d Brizzio told analysts in a conference call. That \u201cwill lead to a delay in the possibility of us taking a decision on that project,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe sense it has more than likely been shelved for the foreseeable future,\u201d HSBC Holdings Plc\u2019s analyst Jonathan Brandt said in an Oct. 4 report.\nTernium is among the companies bidding for ThyssenKrupp AG\u2019s Rio de Janeiro steel plant, according to two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. The German steelmaker said in May it may sell the plant, along with U.S. assets as part of \u201cstrategic options.\u201d ThyssenKrupp declined to comment on the number or names of bidders.\nStart of Operations\nRio de Janeiro-based LLX, which has invested 2.9 billion reais in the complex since 2007, delayed the start of operations to next year from the second-half of 2012. It has signed contracts with companies including London-based miner Anglo American, oil-services providers Subsea 7 SA and Technip SA.\nAcu\u2019s revenue won\u2019t be hurt significantly in the short term because there are other oil and mining projects still in the works, said William Castro Alves, an analyst at brokerage XP Investimentos.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the current market valuation of LLX includes this project anymore, so a cancellation shouldn\u2019t have a big impact,\u201d he said in a telephone interview from Rio. \u201cThese investments take time. They may not happen now, but can resume in the future.\u201d\nShares Tumble\nShares of Batista\u2019s commodities and energy companies tumbled in June after his oil startup, OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3) , cut production targets at its first two oil wells by as much as 75 percent. The drop dragged down Batista\u2019s mining, logistics and shipbuilding companies on concern the enterprises, some of which rely on OGX for revenue, will also scale back targets.

The talks follow an agreement to sell a 49 percent stake in Batista\u2019s AUX gold business to the Qatar Investment Authority for about $2 billion, a person with knowledge of the transaction told Bloomberg in June.\nBatista, 55, has already announced four other divestures this year as he slows the pace of expansion into mining and energy across Latin America and focuses on raising the cash to increase output at his existing companies. All six of Batista\u2019s traded companies had negative cash flow in the second quarter.\n\u201cHe has a lot of projects, so the question now is of funding for the projects he already has,\u201d said Andre Castello Branco, a partner of corporate finance at PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP. \u201cThe projects are getting bigger, so there needs to be some sort of negotiations to raise that capital.\u201d\nEBX Group Co., the holding company for most of Batista\u2019s assets, denied the billionaire is in talks to sell OSX in an e- mailed statement today.\nOSX Gains\nRio de Janeiro-based OSX rose 8.7 percent in Sao Paulo this year, the only one of Batista\u2019s companies to post gains in the stock market, as it announced contracts to build vessels for clients including Petroleo Brasileiro SA. (PETR4)\nBatista\u2019s oil unit OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA fell to a three-year low in June after cutting output estimates at its first project by as much as 75 percent, triggering a selloff at Batista\u2019s other companies. OGX has declined 53 percent this year, the worst performer on the benchmark Bovespa index , which is up 6.6 percent, while Batista\u2019s iron-ore miner MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA lost 21 percent and power utility MPX Energia SA (MPXE3) declined 14 percent.\nOSX dropped 1.5 percent to 12.50 reais at the close in Sao Paulo today, while OGX dropped 2.9 percent, MMX fell 0.9 percent and MPX lost 1.4 percent.\nThe deal with Sete Brasil would give Batista, Brazil \u2019s richest person, a better chance at scoring contracts for $27 billion in deep-water drilling vessels being ordered by Petrobras, a minority shareholder in Sete Brasil.\nCombine Operations\nOSX and Sete Brasil would combine operations to provide services to Petrobras, according to the people with direct knowledge, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. Talks, which are in an early stage among Sete Brasil shareholders and Batista, may not result in a deal, the people said.\nSete Brasil said none of its directors are involved in negotiating a merger, according to an e-mailed statement from its press office.\nA deal with OSX may not make sense because Sete Brasil was created to act as a mediator between Petrobras and shipbuilders, said Adriano Pires , head of consulting firm Brazilian Center for Infrastructure, or CBIE.\n\u201cFrom the moment that Sete Brasil buys part or all of OSX, it will lose that feature because it will become the owner of a shipyard,\u201d he said in a telephone interview from Rio de Janeiro. \u201cPetrobras, as a partner at Sete, will also be a partial owner of the shipyard.\u201d\nEike\u2019s Strategy\nBatista is pursuing a strategy of finding partners to help his companies reach their goals by providing funding and expertise, said Dany Rappaport, who helps manage about 250 million reais at Investport in Sao Paulo.\n\u201cSete Brasil\u2019s partners are very strong, with an elevated capacity for investments,\u201d he said in a telephone interview yesterday. \u201cIt\u2019s not a change in Eike\u2019s strategy.\u201d\nOSX\u2019s press office declined to comment yesterday. Qatar Investment Authority\u2019s press office in Doha also wouldn\u2019t comment.\nBatista\u2019s net worth, which peaked at $34.5 billion on March 27, was $22 billion as of yesterday, making him the world\u2019s 26th richest man, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index daily ranking. Batista raised about $6 billion in share sales in the past six years and at least $4.1 billion in bond sales in international markets since 2011.\n\u2018Good Outlook\u2019\nBatista this year sold stakes in EBX valued at $2.3 billion to Mubadala Development Co. and General Electric Co. He also completed deals with EON AG and International Business Machines Corp., which acquired stakes in his electricity and technology units. In June, he said he expected to find buyers for 30 percent to 50 percent of his coal unit CCX Carvao da Colombia SA (CCXC3) by the end of the year after hiring Morgan Stanley to help find a partner.\nSete Brasil Chief Executive Officer Joao Ferraz said on Sept. 19  the company was close to raising 3.7 billion reais in additional capital, boosting its total equity to 11.3 billion reais. Banco BTG Pactual SA\u2019s private-equity funds invested $1 billion in Sete Brasil, more than doubling their stake in the oil-rig operator to 30 percent, four people with direct knowledge of the deal said in August.\nOSX, which is in talks to build 10 more vessels after winning orders worth $7 billion, sees a \u201cgood outlook\u201d for its negotiations with Sete Brasil to provide drilling ships, Chief Executive Officer Carlos Bellot said at a news conference in Rio on Sept. 17.\nThe oil industry has enormous demand for drilling platforms and a deal between OSX and Sete Brasil would help reduce the risks for the companies involved in the projects, PwC\u2019s Castello Branco said.\n\u201cThis increases the scale and helps reduce the risk for everyone,\u201d he said.

LLX said late yesterday that the billionaire suspended his plan after Bank of America Corp.\u2019s Merrill Lynch, selected by minority shareholders to analyze the proposed deal, concluded Batista would have to pay 6.94 reais to 7.63 reais a share for the Rio de Janeiro-based company.\n\u201cThe market is reacting badly because he removed the offer,\u201d Rogerio Freitas, a partner at hedge fund Teorica Investimentos, said in a telephone interview from Rio de Janeiro . \u201cInvestors are not looking now at value.\u201d\nBatista, who controls six publicly traded companies, owns 372 million shares of LLX, which is building the Acu port in Rio de Janeiro state. The next largest shareholder is the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan , which holds a 17.9 percent stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ontario Teachers\u2019 had agreed to boost its stake in the company through the Batista offer.\nBatista, 55, has seen his wealth dwindle this year after investors were disappointed by production and reserve estimates at oil producer OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA, his biggest holding.

Chief Financial Officer Roberto Monteiro said OGX, based in Rio de Janeiro, will only reach output of 70,000 barrels a day, about enough to break even on cash flow , at some point after 2013. As recently as March the company planned to reach 150,000 barrels a day before the end of 2013.\nOGX removed long-term production targets from presentations in June after its first two wells pumped about 5,000 barrels a day each, less than the company expected. Batista replaced four top executives, including Chief Executive Officer Paulo Mendonca, after a June 26 reduction in production goals caused OGX to slump 40 percent in two days. The head of strategic alliances also left and hasn\u2019t been replaced.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be spending and decreasing our cash position over time,\u201d Monteiro said in an interview at OGX\u2019s downtown Rio offices yesterday. \u201cWhen we start producing something around 70,000 barrels a day we will have a break even. This is why we don\u2019t see ourselves returning to the market.\u201d\nThe company had $2.9 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter. It pumped 10,600 barrels a day in August at its first two wells and will add a third before the end of the year. OGX plans to install two additional production vessels in late 2013 at the Campos Basin and will gradually increase output. Each vessel, known as an FPSO, has an installed capacity of 100,000 barrels a day.\nOGX rose 1.6 percent to 6.26 reais at 2:48 p.m. in Sao Paulo , compared with a 1.7 percent gain in Brazil \u2019s benchmark stock index.\nWorst Bovespa Stock\nThe timing of when OGX reaches 70,000 barrels a day depends on how fast it connects production wells to the new equipment, he said.\nOGX is the worst-performing stock in the Brazilian benchmark Bovespa index this year after falling 55 percent. Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the state-controlled oil producer, dropped 4.2 percent while the Bovespa index gained 0.2 percent. HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA , a pre-operational oil company exploring in Brazil\u2019s Amazon that is not a member of the Bovespa index, slumped 61 percent after it disappointed investors by only finding natural gas and no oil.\nMore Conservative\n\u201cThey are more conservative so they don\u2019t create very optimist market expectations,\u201d Erick Scott Hood, an analyst at SLW Corretora, said by telephone from Sao Paulo. \u201cThey still have the big challenge of developing the exploration campaign and trying to fulfill the schedule,\u201d\nOGX, which went public in 2008, is the main pillar in Batista\u2019s empire of interlinked oil, mining, shipbuilding and logistics companies and propelled him to become Brazil\u2019s richest man. OGX rents its production vessels from shipbuilder OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) and will process and ship oil from a port owned by LLX Logistica SA. (LLXL3) All his companies end in X to represent the multiplication of wealth, according to Batista.\nThe plunge in OGX and subsequent losses in his other companies knocked Batista off the list of the world\u2019s top richest people. Batista, whose fortune peaked at $34.5 billion in March as the eighth largest, is now worth $20.2 billion, making him number 27 in the Bloomberg Billionaire index.\nOf the 18 analysts who rate OGX, nine have buy recommendations, seven have hold recommendations and two say sell.\nThe lower production rates at each well don\u2019t reduce the total amount of oil the company can extract from below the seabed, Monteiro said. It will take the company longer to produce the oil from a larger number of wells, and producing at a slower pace will guarantee oil doesn\u2019t get stranded in the reservoir, he said.\n\u201cThe name of the game is recovery factor,\u201d Monteiro said. \u201cThis is how we maximize the value of the company, not cash flow for tomorrow.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Peter Millard in Rio de Janeiro at pmillard1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Adriana Arai at aarai1@bloomberg.net ; James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net\nBatista OGX Profit Takes Longer on Output Woes: Corporate Brazil\nJonathan Alcorn/Bloomberg\nEike Batista, whose fortune peaked at $34.5 billion in March as the eighth largest, is now worth $20.2 billion, making him number 27 in the Bloomberg Billionaire index.\nEike Batista, whose fortune peaked at $34.5 billion in March as the eighth largest, is now worth $20.2 billion, making him number 27 in the Bloomberg Billionaire index.

MPX declined 2 percent to 11.70 reais, while LLX fell 0.9 percent to 3.19 reais and OSX added 1.3 percent to 11.80 reais.\nDwindling Wealth\nThe stock plunge slashed Batista\u2019s net worth, which peaked at $34.5 billion on March 27, to $20.6 billion yesterday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index daily ranking. Batista, who aims to become the world\u2019s richest person by 2015, currently ranks 23rd on the list.\nBatista plans to invest $50 billion in 10 years to expand mining, energy and port projects in Brazil , Colombia and Chile . He has raised about $6 billion in share sales in the past six years and at least another $4.1 billion in bond sales in international markets since 2011. This year, he sold stakes in his EBX Group Co. holding company valued at $2.3 billion to Mubadala Development Co. and General Electric Co. In May, he said he will sell an additional stake worth $500 million by September.\nEnough Cash\nOGX, which had $2.9 billion in cash at the end of June, has enough money to cover investments and doesn\u2019t plan to sell more debt, Chief Financial Officer Roberto Monteiro said on an Aug. 15 conference call with analysts. It may raise as much as $700 million by selling oil production in advance to help finance investments, he said.\nBatista, in addition to setting the $1 billion target for combined Ebitda this year, also said in a March 2 interview with Bloomberg that the companies would double the measure of profit in 2013 and triple it in 2014. Last year, he said EBX, which controls his mining and energy empire, would generate $15 billion in Ebitda by 2015.\n\u201cWe are running like, what\u2019s the name of this Jamaican guy? Usain Bolt,\u201d Batista said, referring to the first sprinter to win three gold medals in two straight Olympic Summer Games.\nThe companies controlled by Batista\u2019s EBX are in an investment phase, the holding company said in an e-mailed response to questions, declining to comment further.\nMMX, the biggest source of revenue among Batista\u2019s companies, this month posted a quarterly net loss that topped analysts\u2019 estimates after a weaker Brazilian real boosted debt costs and iron-ore sales fell.\n\u2018Exposed to Debt\u2019\nThe real plunged 9.1 percent in the second quarter, the worst performance against the dollar among the world\u2019s 16 most- traded currencies.

He was selling Brazil.\nThat\u2019s why, when Batista\u2019s oil venture reduced production targets less than six months after pumping its first barrel of crude -- deepening a sell-off that erased $15 billion from his net worth and $21 billion in market value in three months --also in doubt was his vision of Brazil as a new powerhouse on the world stage.\nBatista, 55, became Brazil\u2019s richest man by riding a wave of optimism about his country\u2019s prospects that culminated in a 7.5 percent surge in gross domestic product in 2010. Under President Dilma Rousseff , economic growth is now stalling for a second year, and is forecast at 2 percent in 2012, the slowest among the BRIC nations of Brazil, Russia, India and China.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Eike right now is unfortunately a reflection of what\u2019s going on in the country as a whole,\u201d said Simon Nocera, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund , who now runs San Francisco-based Lumen Advisors LLC. \u201cIt\u2019s more of those boom and bust scenarios of the past.\u201d\nAs global commodity prices slipped into a bear market last month, economists surveyed by Brazil\u2019s central bank have cut their forecast for the country\u2019s economic growth this year for nine weeks running. Retail sales fell in May by the most since 2008 amid rising consumer defaults. Brazil\u2019s benchmark stock index is down 23 percent since the end of 2010, with Batista\u2019s oil producer, OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA, among the biggest losers.\nResolve Unshaken\nBatista\u2019s resolve remains unshaken. After share prices for his six publicly traded companies recovered some of their losses this month, his net worth has rebounded to $20.4 billion from a low of $19.6 billion on June 28, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index . He is the 22nd richest person in the world.\n\u201cMy fortune is in my assets,\u201d Batista posted to his almost 1 million Twitter followers on July 1. \u201cSince I didn\u2019t sell a single share, I didn\u2019t lose anything!\u201d\nIn an e-mailed response to questions, Batista\u2019s holding company, EBX Group Co., said its companies have enough cash to plow ahead with a $15.7 billion investment plan. While its oldest public venture, MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA, didn\u2019t turn a profit in 2011, it produced 7.5 million tons of iron ore . OGX, even after missing its targets, went from inception to production in less than five years -- which Batista has called a \u201cworld record.\u201d\nOGX\u2019s shares fell by the most since June 29 in Sao Paulo trading today, dropping 4.6 percent to 5.64 reais. MMX slid 4.6 percent to 5.61 reais, as the Bovespa (IBOV) index lost 0.3 percent.\nPunishing Market\n\u201cYou are going to have these kind of setbacks,\u201d said Laurence Balter, who oversees $100 million for Fox Island, Washington-based Oracle Investment Research and increased his holdings in OGX after the plunge. \u201cEike has put his foot in his mouth on more than one occasion, and the market is punishing him for that.\u201d\nDuring former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva \u2019s time in office, from 2003 through 2010, tens of millions of people were lifted from poverty as economic growth quickened, borrowing costs fell and public finances improved. The Bovespa stock index rose six-fold as China\u2019s growing appetite for commodities increased earnings for Brazil\u2019s biggest companies: iron-ore miner Vale SA and oil producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA. (PETR4)\nBatista promised to compete against the two giants with his own startup ventures, and filled top management spots with their former executives -- including his own father, Eliezer, who has served both as mining minister and Vale chief. Batista, who said in April 2010 that Lula \u201cwalks on water,\u201d has relied on subsidized loans from Brazil\u2019s national development bank, known as the BNDES, in addition to cash from private investors.\nBiggest Successes\nHis two biggest successes came in the first half of 2008, as prices for oil and iron ore approached record highs: the 6.7 billion-real ($3.3 billion) initial public offering of OGX, and the $5.5 billion sale of the Minas-Rio mining business to Anglo American (AAL) Plc. OGX also benefited from optimism surrounding Brazil\u2019s recent announcement of the largest oil discovery in the Americas since 1976 -- the Tupi field, since renamed Lula.\nThe euphoria surrounding Brazil\u2019s prospects began to waver at the start of 2010, with a credit-fueled rebound from the 2009 recession raising the specter of an overheating economy -- just as Batista was preparing to sell shares in OSX Brasil SA. (OSXB3) The shipbuilding venture ultimately raised just a quarter of what he\u2019d initially sought, after investors balked at putting up cash for a company whose main asset was the guarantee of orders from OGX, which had still yet to produce a drop of oil.\nBallooning Costs\nBoth companies have repeatedly failed to meet Batista\u2019s targets in bringing their operations online. Even after beginning to produce revenues, OSX is now trading at less than a third of the price offered in its initial sale, while OGX has lost half its value.\nThe Minas-Rio iron-ore project -- now Anglo American\u2019s largest -- has also failed to meet expectations. Beset by legal challenges and ballooning costs, the project is slated to come online in 2013, after having initially been projected to start by 2010.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be ready in 2026,\u201d said Joao Carlos Cavalcanti, who partnered with Batista on an iron-ore business that was later subsumed into MMX. \u201cEike told them it had 750 million tons of ore, but it doesn\u2019t have 150 million. They fell for Eike\u2019s blue eyes. He\u2019s very beguiling.\u201d\nThe geologist, now developing rare-earth deposits in northeast Brazil, is suing Batista for allegedly failing to make agreed investments in their joint venture. \u201cThe guy is a bubble,\u201d Cavalcanti said.\nEBX declined to comment on Cavalcanti\u2019s allegations . MMX said its chances of losing the lawsuit are \u201cprobable,\u201d according to a regulatory filing detailing legal liabilities.\nOne Dividend\nIn six years, Batista\u2019s six publicly traded companies have made just one dividend payment -- and that because of a one-time financial gain. Still, the dearth of cash hasn\u2019t stopped Batista from diversifying into a slew of new closely held ventures, from technology to Rio de Janeiro real estate to sports and music events-management.\nIn an interview with Bloomberg News in March, Batista said he exemplified a new \u201cBrazilian dream\u201d of entrepreneurial success. He repeated his goal of overtaking Carlos Slim as the world\u2019s richest man by 2015, a feat that would require him to double his wealth at the time.\nBatista\u2019s net worth peaked at $34.5 billion on March 27, after he sold a 5.6 percent stake in EBX, the umbrella for most of his assets, to Abu Dhabi\u2019s Mubadala Development Co. for $2 billion.\nGreat Salesman\nWhile boosting his personal fortune, the deal did little to comfort investors in his publicly traded companies. Shares continued to sink even after Batista sold another $300 million stake in EBX to General Electric Co. in May. The sell-off peaked when OGX announced last month it was cutting output targets for its first two wells by as much as 75 percent, intensifying doubts as to whether he\u2019d oversold his companies\u2019 prospects.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s actually true, and what\u2019s just the fact that he\u2019s a great salesman?\u201d asked Henrique de La Rocque, who manages 300 million reais at Brasif Gestao de Recursos in Rio de Janeiro. He said he\u2019s holding on to his OGX shares at least until the \u201cpanic\u201d subsides.\nTrack Record\nIn its e-mailed response to questions, EBX pointed to Batista\u2019s 30-year track record in developing eight gold mines and one silver mine across Brazil, Canada and Chile . Batista pursued -- and abandoned -- several companies during that time. In 1999, Batista sold a water business to a unit of Enron Corp. for $55 million, telling Bloomberg News after the deal: \u201cGold is a Jurassic industry. Water is the industry of the 21st century.\u201d\nBatista\u2019s success lies in finding the right projects and picking good teams, according to Carl Hansen, who spent a decade working with Batista at TVX Gold Inc. in Toronto in the 1990s.\n\u201cWithout question he has a talent for identifying undervalued assets, and then increasing the value of those assets by doing the work and then finding investors to move them forward,\u201d said Hansen, who worked at TVX first as a geologist and later as its director of investor relations .\nAs TVX\u2019s chairman, chief executive and largest shareholder, Batista led the company\u2019s market value to peak at more than $1.7 billion in 1996 as he invested in projects around the globe. A series of legal challenges, combined with a five-year slump in gold prices , drove the company\u2019s value down to less than $150 million by the end of 2000.\n\u2018Marketing Story\u2019\nToday, with the slowdown in China\u2019s economy dragging down raw-material prices, Batista has plowed 2.6 billion reais into LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3) \u2019s Acu port project in Rio de Janeiro state. In March 2010 he said the complex will be a \u201chighway to China\u201d once completed.\nA popular adage holds that Brazil is the country of the future, and always will be. For the past six years, Batista has sought to sell the idea that Brazil\u2019s future had finally arrived, according to Nocera, the former IMF economist.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a wonderful marketing story,\u201d Nocera said. \u201cWhen you make a lot of promises, sooner or later you need to deliver.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Alexander Cuadros in Sao Paulo at acuadros@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Matthew G.

Before yesterday, the company had a consensus analyst rating of 4.5, the highest of any company in Brazil after iron-ore producer Vale SA. (VALE) The rating, which is the average within a range of one to five, with five being the highest, fell to 4.39.

In addition to slashing borrowing costs more than any other member of the Group of 20 since last August, the government has also cut taxes on consumer goods and boosted public investment to ensure economic growth of 4.5 percent this year.\nGross domestic product expanded 2.7 percent in 2011, less than that of Brazil\u2019s neighbors and below the 3 percent growth by Germany amid the euro debt crisis. Economists forecast growth this year of 3.2 percent and 4.3 percent in 2013, according to an April 13 central bank survey of about 100 analysts.\nThe same survey showed policy makers would keep the Selic rate at 9 percent until March and raise it to 10 percent by July 2013.\n\u2018Laid a Trap\u2019\nRamos said he expects investors to increase bets on another 25 or 50 basis-point cut when the bank\u2019s board next convenes on May 29-30. Since Brazil began targeting inflation in 1999, the Selic has only once before fallen below 10 percent, in the wake of the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.\nSome economists expect the bank will leave rates unchanged at its next meeting after Tombini in an April 9 interview reiterated the guidance provided in the minutes about the limits to its easing strategy.\n\u201cThey laid a trap for themselves,\u201d Andre Perfeito , chief economist for Gradual Investimentos, said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo . \u201cThe Selic rate has been neutralized, and they\u2019ll have to rely on other monetary policy instruments going forward.\u201d\nRousseff has already instructed state-run banks to lower rates in a bid to pressures its private competitors to do the same.

The services sector also expanded 0.7 percent and family consumption rose 0.6 percent.\n\u201cDomestic demand remains the primary support of the economy, with families\u2019 consumption stimulated by moderated expansion in credit, by the generation of jobs and revenue,\u201d central bank President Alexandre Tombini said in a statement today.\nLower Levies\nTo kick start growth that is trailing Russia , India and China, President Dilma Rousseff \u2019s government has cut payroll taxes, lowered levies on cars and appliances and implemented policies that have weakened the real more than any major currency this year. The central bank has done its part by lowering borrowing costs by 500 basis points since last August, more than any Group of 20 nation, taking the benchmark Selic rate this week to a record low 7.5 percent.\n\u201cWe are of the view that we have now reached the end of the current 13-month long easing cycle,\u201d Alberto Ramos , senior economist at Goldman Sachs & Co., said in a research note today, citing a deteriorating inflation outlook. If the bank further reduces rates, it will be with a final cut of 25 basis points in October, he said.\nThe government\u2019s stimulus measures have helped boost vehicle sales from 257,887 in April to 364,196 in July, while a 1.5 percent jump in retail sales in June surprised economists by the most since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 2008.\nDebt Troubles\nStill, lower rates haven\u2019t kept consumers out of debt trouble, suggesting there may be a limit to a recovery led by shoppers. The central bank reported yesterday that the consumer loan default rate rose in July to 7.9 percent, matching a 30- month high.\n\u201cThat exuberant phase of the credit cycle when there was a lot of catching up to do, that is over,\u201d Paulo Vieira da Cunha, head of emerging markets research at Tandem Global Partners, said in a phone interview from New York. \u201cWhat you have now is a normal expansion of credit.\u201d\nEconomists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast Latin America\u2019s biggest economy will grow 1.9 percent this year, less than the 2.15 percent in the U.S. and 2.5 percent in Japan. Finance Minister Guido Mantega said today he sees growth accelerating to 4 percent in the fourth quarter and possibly surpassing 4 percent in 2013.\nExtra Stimulus\nVieira de Cunha is more cautious. The former Brazilian central bank board member says the economy would require additional stimulus for growth to remain at or above 4 percent through 2013, and instead expects the pace of expansion to slow to near 3 percent by the end of next year. This week the government extended the tax cuts for vehicles through October, and for furniture and appliances through the end of the year.\nThe other BRIC nations are also hurting. Russia\u2019s GDP expanded at the slowest annual pace in the second quarter, while China grew the least since 2009. Gross domestic product in India rose 5.5 percent in the second quarter from a year ago, up from the three-year low of 5.3 percent in the previous quarter. Brazil\u2019s economy in the second quarter expanded 0.5 percent from a year ago, lower than the median estimate of 0.7 percent from 47 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\nBrazil\u2019s second-quarter GDP figures do not reflect the turnaround under way in the third quarter, said Tony Volpon , head of emerging-markets research for the Americas at Nomura Securities.\n\u2018Demand-Priming\u2019\n\u201cA lot of the demand-priming actions that the government was taking do need some time to hit the economy, including lower interest rates , and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing now,\u201d Volpon said by telephone from New York. \u201cThe argument the market is having now is how big that bounce will be.\u201d\nThe severity of this year\u2019s slowdown prompted Rousseff to look beyond the consumer-led growth model favored by her predecessor and mentor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , and confront bottlenecks that have long prevented faster growth. Earlier this month, she ignored opposition to privatization by members of her Workers\u2019 Party and announced plans to auction licenses to build and operate 17,500 kilometers (10,850 miles) of roads and railways, a move the government says will attract as much as $66 billion investment over 30 years.\nLow growth in early 2012 was \u201ca wake-up call\u201d that is focusing the government on ways to boost productivity, Gray Newman , chief Latin America economist at Morgan Stanley (MS) , said by phone from New York. \u201cBrazil\u2019s challenge isn\u2019t just dealing with the cycle.\u201d\nHigh Cost\nMore policy action to reduce the high cost of business and boost investment is in the pipeline, including a plan to reduce energy costs for manufacturers that will be announced in mid- September, Rousseff said yesterday.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be a just nation until we\u2019re capable of being a competitive nation,\u201d Rousseff told a group of business leaders in Brasilia.\nThis year\u2019s slowdown hasn\u2019t deterred investors. Drawn by the build-up for the 2014 World Cup and Summer Olympics two years later, the country received $38.1 billion in foreign direct investment this year through July, compared with $38.5 billion in the same period last year. Brazil\u2019s benchmark Bovespa stock index has climbed 9.1 percent since this year\u2019s low on June 5.\nOne reason for the interest in Brazil is pent-up demand from 40 million people who\u2019ve risen out of poverty since 2003 and still are benefitting from near-full employment conditions.\nThe profits of Brazil\u2019s biggest retailer, Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar , rose 180 percent in the second quarter from a year ago, while those at Natura Cosmeticos, Latin America\u2019s largest cosmetics firm, rose 14 percent.\nResilient Demand\nStill, resilient consumer demand hasn\u2019t proved sufficient to sustain an industrial sector battered by the global slowdown. Industrial output fell 5.5 percent in June from the year before. With prices for Brazil\u2019s iron-ore and other raw materials under pressure from slow growth in China, exports so far this year are down 1.7 percent from 2011 levels.\n\u201cThe core scenario as it now stands is for the Brazilian economy to reaccelerate,\u201d said George Hoguet, managing director of State Street Global Advisors in Boston , which has $62 billion invested in emerging market stocks. \u201cBut if there\u2019s a further hiccup in one of the larger economies in the world, that is going to negatively affect Brazil.\u201d\nSwap rates on the contract maturing in January 2014, the most traded in Sao Paulo today, rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.84 percent at 1:01 p.m. local time. The real fell 0.84 percent to 2.0312 per dollar.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: David Biller in Boston at dbiller1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Joshua Goodman at jgoodman19@bloomberg.net\nBrazil Economy Emerges From Slowdown as Stimulus Takes Hold\nDado Galdieri/Bloomberg\nCattle owned by Brazilian beef producer Minerva SA graze in a ranch operated by Cia Agropecuaria Monte Alegre (CMA) in Barretos, Brazil.

Swap rates rose.\nThe volume of sales climbed 1.5 percent, compared with a drop of 0.8 percent in May and the biggest rise since a 3.2 percent jump in January, the national statistics agency said today in Rio de Janeiro. The median forecast of 38 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 0.3 percent decline. Annual sales jumped 9.5 percent.\nPresident Dilma Rousseff \u2019s government has granted tax breaks for goods including furniture, appliances and automobiles to prop up demand and spur faltering growth. The central bank has also cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low 8 percent, while Rousseff\u2019s administration has successfully pressured banks to lower lending rates.\n\u201cThere\u2019s strength across the board,\u201d Italo Lombardi, Latin America economist at Standard Chartered Bank, said by phone from New York . \u201cIt\u2019s a good sign.

Latin America\u2019s biggest economy will grow 1.8 percent this year, its second-worst performance since 2003, according to the latest central bank survey of about 100 analysts. The economy will be growing at a 4 percent annual pace by year-end and will enter 2013 at \u201ccruising speed,\u201d Finance Minister Guido Mantega told reporters today.\n\u201cPolicy makers have become increasingly confident that growth is going to recover quite strongly next year,\u201d Neil Shearing , chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics Ltd., said by telephone from London . \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be the case, but they clearly do and I think we\u2019re getting close to the end of the rate cutting cycle.\u201d\nSwap rates on the contract maturing in January 2014, the most traded in Sao Paulo today, rose 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 7.89 percent at 12:57 p.m. local time. The real rose 0.1 percent to 2.0207 per dollar.\nRate Cuts\nThe central bank has lowered the Selic benchmark rate 450 points since last August. The retail sales results may alter expectations for further cuts, Ines Filipa, chief economist at brokerage Icap do Brasil CTVM, said.\n\u201cThere were traders in the market yesterday expecting two cuts of 50 basis points, one in August and one in October,\u201d Filipa said by telephone from Rio de Janeiro . \u201cThe results from today slightly decrease the expectations for the 50-point adjustment in the October meeting.\u201d\nBolstered by government cuts in the IPI tax on industrialized goods, furniture and appliance sales increased 5.3 percent in June, compared with a 3.3 percent decline in May, the statistics agency said.\nSpending Power\nBrazilian consumers, whose spending has powered growth, have been supported by a strong labor market, even as job creation slows. Unemployment in May was 5.8 percent, a record low for the month.\nThe consumer default rate \u201chas reached its maximum and is starting to fall, and that will open space for consumers to buy goods,\u201d Filipa said. \u201cThe perspective is for a recovery of the economy that could have a positive impact on consumer confidence .\u201d\nThe broader retail index, which includes the sale of cars and construction materials, rose 6.1 percent from May and 12.3 percent from the previous year, the statistics agency said.\nSales of vehicles and auto parts increased 16.4 percent in June from May.

While the slowdown will make it harder for companies to replicate the gains seen in recent years, Oi still has strong growth potential because it only controls about a quarter of the market, he said.\n\u201cThe price war has reached the bottom of the barrel,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should transition to a managed, rational environment.\u201d\nBrazil\u2019s economy expanded 0.8 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the slowest rate since 2009. Economists are expecting gross domestic product to grow 1.85 percent this year, according to a central bank survey released yesterday.\nRising demand for data services such as Internet access and online video may help wireless carriers usher in more stable prices in the next few years than they have been able to maintain for voice, HSBC\u2019s Dineen said.\nTim hasn\u2019t seen evidence of a price war since no carrier is selling services below cost, said Rogerio Tostes, the company\u2019s investor relations director. Data services such as Internet access will fuel additional growth, he said.\n\u201cThe market still has growth ahead,\u201d Tostes said. \u201cWhat we saw in the last few years, with growth of 30 percent a year, will probably slow a little, but the prepaid segment and the lower middle classes still provide lots of opportunity to grow.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Crayton Harrison in Mexico City at tharrison5@bloomberg.net ; Ta\u00eds Fuoco in Sao Paulo at tfuoco1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jessica Brice at jbrice1@bloomberg.net ; Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net\nSlim\u2019s Wireless Hit as Economy Hinders Prices\nPaulo Fridman/Bloomberg\nAmerica Movil\u2019s customers in Brazil more than doubled in the past five years to 60 million wireless subscribers, making it the company\u2019s fastest-growing market after the Caribbean.\nAmerica Movil\u2019s customers in Brazil more than doubled in the past five years to 60 million wireless subscribers, making it the company\u2019s fastest-growing market after the Caribbean.

The carriers pledged to spend a combined 20 billion reais ($9.8 billion) on network upgrades through 2014.\n\u201cThis improvement plan is the first step,\u201d Rezende told reporters yesterday in Brasilia. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be following the evolution in network service improvements, keeping a close eye on the indicators, to make sure the situation doesn\u2019t return to what it was before the ban.\u201d\nThe end of the ban, in place since July 23, would ease the pressure on Rio de Janeiro-based Tim, whose shares fell 23 percent in the month of July amid investor concern the sales ban would slow the carrier\u2019s growth. Tim, a unit of Milan-based Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) , rose 3.6 percent to 9 reais yesterday in Sao Paulo.\nTim, the second-largest Brazilian carrier behind Telefonica Brasil SA, had been barred from selling new plans in 18 states and Brazil\u2019s federal district because of network failures. The company will spend 8.2 billion reais through 2014 on improvements, Rezende said. Tim has budgeted 3 billion reais in capital expenditures in 2012, according to its second-quarter report.\nMovil Investment\nAmerica Movil was blocked in Sao Paulo, the most populous state, and two other states.

The agency also will keep tabs on each company\u2019s rate of customer complaints, he said.\nShowing Improvement\nThe carriers should begin showing improvements in customer service over the phone in the next 30 days, and their networks should begin performing better in four to six months, Rezende said. If there isn\u2019t improvement, the companies\u2019 sales could be suspended again, he said.\nBoth Tim and Rio de Janeiro-based Oi said this week that the government ban won\u2019t affect their forecasts for sales and earnings this year. The investment plans they presented to Anatel won\u2019t require them to increase their budgets for network upgrades this year, the companies said in conference calls with analysts.\nAmerica Movil, based in Mexico City, doesn\u2019t provide a forecast for sales and profits.

The company repeated a forecast that adjusted net debt will fall to about 27.5 billion euros at the end of 2012. \u201cRecent bond issues contributed to maintaining a liquidity margin to cover our debt maturity until 2014,\u201d Bernabe said in the statement.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Chiara Remondini in Milan at cremondini@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:53:26", "post_time": "2012-08-02 03:22:46", "author": "Chiara Remondini", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-02/telecom-italia-first-half-profit-beats-analysts-estimates.html", "title": "Telecom Italia First-Half Profit Beats Analysts Estimates", "post_date": "2012-08-02", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "733cd53d638e7d533b8d589ed79eee7e9aa6399e"}, {"content": "Brazil Said to Demand Phone Companies Share Infrastructure\nBy Carla Simoes - 2012-07-27T20:15:36Z\nBrazil \u2019s telecommunications regulator Anatel may determine at the end of next week that mobile-phone companies should share their infrastructure to increase network capacity, according to a government official familiar with the matter.\nThe announcement may be made at the same time Anatel suspends a ban on sales of voice and data service by Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3) , America Movil SAB (AMXL) \u2019s Claro and Oi SA (OIBR4) , said the person, who asked not to be named because the discussion isn\u2019t public.\nNetwork failures prompted the sales suspension, which started on July 23.

The real gained 0.1 percent to 1.9993 per dollar.\nMajor retailers showed stronger sales in the first quarter and mixed financial results. Sao Paulo-based Cia Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar (PCAR4) , the country\u2019s largest retailer, saw its consolidated first quarter net income rise 25.8 percent to 167 million reais ($83 million) from a year earlier, as same-store sales rose 9.6 percent.\nInternet Sales\nMagazine Luiza SA (MGLU3) , a Sao Paulo-based retailer, posted a loss of 40.7 million reais compared with a 12.3 million reais profit a year earlier. The company said on May 14 it expected sales to grow in the remainder of 2012 fueled by new stores, Internet sales and the \u201creduction in the basic interest rate to its lowest level ever.\u201d\nWith a depreciating real, which makes imported goods more costly, domestic manufacturers expect to claw back market share from foreign competitors, Humberto Barbato, head of the electronics industry group Abinee, told reporters yesterday.\n\u201cGiven the exchange rate , we hope to revert the scenario in the short term, reducing imports,\u201d he said.\nThe real has lost 14.3 percent against the dollar in the past three months, the worst performance among major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.\nThe broader retail index, which includes the sale of cars and construction materials, rose 10.2 percent from the previous year, the statistics agency said.\nAnnual inflation slowed to 5.1 percent in April, the lowest rate in 19 months. The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage points.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Raymond Colitt in Brasilia Newsroom at rcolitt@bloomberg.net ; Joshua Goodman in Rio de Janeiro at jgoodman19@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Joshua Goodman at jgoodman19@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:53:39", "post_time": "2012-05-17 10:17:32", "author": "Raymond Colitt , Joshua Goodman", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-17/brazil-annual-retail-sales-rise-at-fastest-pace-in-two-years-1-.html", "title": "Brazil March Retail Sales Rise Offsets Industrial Weakness", "post_date": "2012-05-17", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "d9f855d48be73318ee0a5bd9ccc8b1cc943b75f9"}, {"content": "Brazil Company Sales Miss Analysts\u2019 Estimates Most Since \u201809\nBy Ney Hayashi and Denyse Godoy - 2012-08-16T20:18:04Z\nBrazilian companies missed analysts\u2019 revenue estimates by the most since 2009 in the second quarter as the slowdown in Latin America \u2019s biggest economy curbed domestic demand.\nOf 58 companies listed on the benchmark Bovespa index that reported, 32 missed sales forecasts from Redecard SA (RDCD3) , Brazil\u2019s second-biggest card-payment processor to PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos & Participacoes, the nation\u2019s third-biggest homebuilder, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The 55 percent ratio after the Bovespa companies\u2019 final earnings reports were released yesterday is the highest since the first quarter of 2009, according to the data.\nSales trailed estimates even after policy makers cut interest rates to a record low, reduced taxes on consumer and industrial goods and boosted state-backed development loans to help shore up growth that eased to 0.75 percent in the first three months of 2012, the slowest pace among the region\u2019s major economies.

The same survey showed a median growth forecast of 3.3 percent on Jan. 9.\nEurope\u2019s debt crisis helps to explain the slowdown in Brazil, as a cooling global economy affected the country\u2019s exports, said Alvaro Bandeira, a partner and chief economist at Orama Asset Management\nCorporate earnings in Brazil may pick up in coming months should policy makers around the globe take further steps to boost the recovery, Bandeira said.\n\u201cThe second half of 2012, especially the last quarter, should be better for the Brazilian companies on the Bovespa,\u201d Bandeira said by phone from Sao Paulo . \u201cThings should improve if European and American leaders take more measures to revert the crisis.\u201d\nSecond-Quarter Earnings\nThirty-six companies out of 58 on the Bovespa index reported earnings that missed forecasts in the second quarter, including Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil\u2019s state-controlled oil company, and Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA, Brazil\u2019s second- biggest airline by market value.

It\u2019s also where millionaire Antonio Claudio Resende, a founder of Latin America \u2019s largest car-rental company, became a squatter.\nThere, starting in 2006, he cleared pristine jungle where wild bromeliad flowers grow to make way for a 1,752-square-meter mansion, according to the Rio de Janeiro state environmental agency. The house -- which is built partially underground and hidden by surrounding lush forest -- is visible only from above by aircraft.\nResende, 65, broke the rules that gave him the right to occupy the land on a nature preserve, not to build a large home, Brazilian federal judges found. He has been fighting civil and criminal charges against him for more than four years, filing appeals while defying court orders to demolish the house and leave, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its April issue.\nResende is among scores of millionaires who spend weekends and vacation time in homes built in violation of state and federal environmental rules on some of the most beautiful real estate in Brazil , Rio\u2019s state environmental institute, INEA, found in an August 2011 report.\nThe squatters include movie director Bruno Barreto, who destroyed preserved land on Pico Island in Paraty Bay, prosecutors say.\nBeachfront Compounds\nOthers, such as the family that controls multinational construction giant Camargo Correa SA, received government permission to build small houses in a nature preserve -- and instead constructed beachfront compounds.\nHeirs to Roberto Marinho, who created Organizacoes Globo, South America\u2019s biggest media group, built a 1,300-square-meter (14,000-square-foot) home, helipad and swimming pool in part of the Atlantic coastal forest that by law is supposed to be untouched because of its ecology.\nHollywood producers chose a Polynesian-style mansion on the Mamangua Inlet as the romantic setting for a sex scene in \u201cThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1,\u201d the fourth movie in the teen vampire series. The house was built by millionaire squatter Icaro Fernandes, an executive in the food distribution industry.\nAll Brazilian beaches are public by law. Wealthy Brazilians do whatever they want on land that often doesn\u2019t belong to them, says Eduardo Godoy of the Paraty office of the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation, or ICMBio , which manages federally protected areas.\n\u2018Not What the Law Says\u2019\n\u201cThey think they are the only ones who deserve to enjoy a piece of paradise because they are rich,\u201d Godoy says. \u201cThey say they are the owners of the island or the beach, and everybody believes them. But that\u2019s not what the law says.\u201d\nFernandes declined to comment. Rogerio Zouein, his lawyer, admitted that Fernandes had built a house without a license. Zouein told prosecutors in April 2011 that Fernandes would restore 95 percent of his property to its original condition if he could stay in the home. Prosecutors were evaluating the request as of early March.\nThat court response is a common way that many of the wealthy squatters use to handle judges\u2019 orders. They typically don\u2019t deny they\u2019ve harmed the environment and instead pledge to undo the damage. After that, they take no action.\nBroken Promise\nFilm director Barreto promised in court in January 2008 that he would demolish his house and put the area back to its original state within two years. Four years later, Barreto remains on the property, having left it intact, prosecutors say. Barreto, who is appealing government complaints again him, declined to comment.\nAs the wealthy in Brazil get richer from the fastest economic growth there in more than two decades, the unlawful use of public land is increasing in nature preserves, says Godoy, whose federal environmental agency in Paraty, a 17th-century colonial town about 250 kilometers (155 miles) south of Rio de Janeiro , faces a bay filled with illegally occupied islands.\nSquatters have chosen to reside in the Cairucu, Juatinga and Tamoios conservation areas, in forests and on islands, with rivers, waterfalls and beaches where sea turtles nest. The rich use attorneys to dodge laws, lie to authorities on construction permit requests, illegally destroy preserved land and rivers and privatize beaches by hiring armed security guards to keep out visitors, Godoy says.\nLaw enforcers and judges pushing to remove squatters from nature preserves have little clout, says Fernando Amorim Lavieri, a federal prosecutor who spent three years in the Paraty area. Rich Brazilians can get away with almost anything, Lavieri says.\n\u2018Drag On\u2019\n\u201cThe law is the same for the poor and the rich, but the rich have the best lawyers,\u201d he says. \u201cLawsuits against them drag on in court for years.\u201d\nBrazil\u2019s economy, fueled by a credit surge and booming exports during the past decade, has boosted the value of assets, including real estate, stocks , bonds and commodities, thereby creating 19 new millionaires every day in a country of 190 million people, according to the 2010 World Wealth Report by Capgemini SA (CAP) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch .\nBrazilians have a collective net worth of $890 billion, or 39 percent of all individual assets in South America, according to a November 2011 report by Wealth-X, a Singapore-based research firm.\nSquatters take advantage of loopholes in the laws, Lavieri says. Starting in 1983, the federal government enacted laws to preserve the regions of Paraty and nearby Angra dos Reis because rare species at risk of extinction inhabit them. Local statutes allow some people to live there because indigenous fishing families have been in now-preserved areas for generations.\n\u2018Follow the Rules\u2019\nEveryone who buys a right to a property in a conservation area must follow strict limits on what they can build, if they\u2019re allowed to build at all.\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t follow the rules, the government can revoke their right to occupy the land and order them to demolish whatever they built,\u201d says Jose Olimpio Augusto Morelli, an environmental analyst who heads the office of Ibama , Brazil\u2019s federal environmental agency, in Angra dos Reis.\nIbama ordered Resende to tear down the house he was building on Cavala Island.\nForged Documents\nFederal prosecutors charged Resende, vice chairman and the largest shareholder of Localiza Rent a Car SA , with fraud and environmental crime in November 2007. Resende had filed forged documents in seeking permits to build his mansion on Cavala Island, according to the criminal charges.\nIn March 2008, federal police, Ibama and state government agents raided Cavala from two speedboats and found the hidden paradise. In that raid, Morelli says, he saw two huge machines that Resende used to excavate more than 2,000 square meters of earth to hide his mansion below the tree line.\n\u201cI saw a fireplace big enough to fit a car, and there were huge piles of marble everywhere, waiting to be placed on the floors and walls,\u201d Morelli says.\nProsecutors sued Resende in a civil case in August 2008, saying he had violated environmental rules.\nResende paid 4.8 million reais ($2.8 million) in November 2005 to AC Lobato Engenharia SA, an engineering company based in Angra dos Reis that had previously owned the right to occupy the land, according to a federal police investigation.\nResende has been appealing the civil and criminal accusations. He said in a court-filed response that federal judges shouldn\u2019t rule on the case because the Tamoios conservation area was created by a state decree. Sergio Rosenthal, his lawyer, said in court that Resende doesn\u2019t know anything about fraud or forged documents.\nOnly Tropical Fjord\nOn the other side of Paraty Bay, Icaro Fernandes, owner of Rhino Participacoes & Distribuidora de Alimentos Ltda., a Sao Paulo-based wholesale food distributor, bought a 400,000-square- -meter piece of land in 2003 on Praia da Costa beach on the Mamangua Inlet.\nThe property, in the 8,000-hectare (19,800-acre) Juatinga ecological preserve, is protected because it\u2019s home to the only tropical fjord in South America . The spot is flanked by mountains covered with virtually untouched forest where monkeys, anteaters and jaguars live.\nFernandes constructed a two-story, 666-square-meter home on the beach, prosecutors say in a civil court case against him. The 15-room house has wooden shutters and glass-panel windows on the ground floor. A guesthouse and a housekeeper\u2019s chalet sit up a hill.\nFernandes Sued\nFederal prosecutors sued Fernandes in November 2004 for not obtaining an environmental license to build. He had cut down parts of the protected forest, filled in a stream and removed coastal vegetation, federal prosecutor Patricia Venancio wrote in a Jan. 3, 2006, report.\nA court ordered Fernandes in 2004 to stop construction, and he didn\u2019t. Since then, he\u2019s been appealing judicial demands to tear down the house he completed and restore the land to its original state, according to a September 2011 report by ICMBio.\nPaul Pflug, a spokesman for Summit Entertainment Corp., (SUET) says the company isn\u2019t aware of prosecutor accusations regarding the property where it filmed Breaking Dawn.\nMost millionaires register properties in the names of holding companies, allowing them to pay lower taxes and making it more difficult for the government to know who\u2019s responsible for environmental crimes, says Ricardo Martins, a federal prosecutor. Often, the companies are controlled by other companies based in tax havens .\nModernist Home\nThat\u2019s the case with the Marinho media family. The Marinhos broke environmental laws by building a 1,300-square-meter mansion just off Santa Rita beach, near Paraty, says Graziela Moraes Barros, an inspector at ICMBio.\nWithout permits, the family in 2008 built a modernist home between two wide, independent concrete blocks sheathed in glass, Barros says. The Marinho home has won several architectural honors, including the 2010 Wallpaper Design Award.\nThe Marinhos added a swimming pool on the public beach and cleared protected jungle to make room for a helipad, says Barros, who participated in a raid of the property as part of the federal prosecutors office\u2019s lawsuit against construction on the land.\n\u201cThis one house provides examples of some of the most serious environmental crimes we see in the region,\u201d Barros says. \u201cA lot of people say the Marinhos rule Brazil. The beach house shows the family certainly thinks they are above the law.\u201d\nArmed Guards\nTwo security guards armed with pistols patrol the land, shooing away anyone who tries to use the public beach, she says. A federal judge in November 2010 ordered the family to tear down the house and all other buildings in the area. The Marinhos were appealing that ruling as of early March.\nTheir lawyer, Corina Tarcila de Oliveira Resende, who\u2019s not related to Antonio Claudio Resende, declined to comment.\nBarreto built his dream house on an island 15 kilometers from the Marinho compound. The film director has no right to use the land, police say. Prosecutors charged Barreto in February 2006 with illegally clearing protected forest in an area that belongs to Brazil\u2019s navy.\nA September 2008 inspection by ICMBio found that Barreto had built a 450-square-meter mansion on top of rocks that surround the island -- a crime because the area is protected as a breeding ground for several species, ICMBio\u2019s Godoy says.\nBarreto, who was married to actress Amy Irving and who directed \u201cView From the Top\u201d starring Gwyneth Paltrow and \u201cCarried Away\u201d with Dennis Hopper , hasn\u2019t made good on his 2008 court promise to demolish the house. He and his lawyers, Arthur Lavigne and Fernanda Silva Telles, didn\u2019t reply to requests for comment.\nBillionaire Compound\nThe owners of Camargo Correa (CCIM3) , Brazil\u2019s largest construction conglomerate, also built on preserved land, Barros says. Agropecuaria & Comercial Conquista Ltda. and Regimar Comercial SA own the land. Fernando de Arruda Botelho is the owner of Agropecuaria.\nHe\u2019s married to billionaire Rosana Camargo de Arruda Botelho. Regina de Camargo Pires Oliveira Dias, Rosana\u2019s sister, owns Regimar. The family built a luxury compound in the Cairucu nature preserve, according to reports by Ibama. In October 2011, the family illegally built two 700-square-meter houses, adding to the already unauthorized construction, Barros says.\nIn June 2010, the beach was the venue for the wedding of Fernando Augusto Camargo de Arruda Botelho, Fernando Botelho\u2019s son. About 800 guests attended.\nContradictory and Confusing\nFernando Botelho declined to comment. Regimar executive director Jose Sampaio Correa says the company obtained the required licenses for construction. He says environmental rules in conservation areas are sometimes contradictory and confusing. Brazil\u2019s bureaucracy often makes it difficult to comply with the laws, he says.\n\u201cThese actions are proof that they completely disregard the law, they take ownership of natural resources and believe their rights are greater than the rights of everybody else,\u201d prosecutor Lavieri says.\nAs environmental investigator Morelli gets ready in his office for another boat raid one sunny January morning, he admires the beautiful islands and forests he sees from his windows. He says he dreams of a day when rich Brazilians will set the example of how to do things right. Until then, he says, money will continue to be more powerful than the law.\nEditors: Jonathan Neumann, Gail Roche\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Adriana Brasileiro in Rio de Janeiro at abrasileiro@bloomberg.net .\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jonathan Neumann at jneumann2@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-20 21:54:19", "post_time": "2012-03-08 00:00:01", "author": "Adriana Brasileiro", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-08/brazil-s-rich-build-homes-in-nature-preserves.html", "title": "Brazil\u2019s Rich Show No Shame Building Homes in Nature Preserves", "post_date": "2012-03-08", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "4858e008f3d9ac40b3b8c79405940d962bd255e4"}, {"content": "Emerging Stocks in Best Winning Streak Since 2010 on U.S. Jobs\nBy Zachary Tracer and Shikhar Balwani - 2012-02-03T23:02:55Z\nEmerging-market stocks climbed for a fifth straight week as the U.S. jobless rate slid to the lowest level in three years, boosting the outlook for the global economy.\nThe MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) rose 0.4 percent to 1,048.36 in New York , bringing its advance this week to 14 percent and capping the longest run of weekly gains since October 2010.

Slim remains the world\u2019s richest person with a $77.6 billion fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\u201cThese disappointing earnings announcements are finally weighing on investors,\u201d Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Harris Private Bank in Chicago, which oversees about $60 billion of assets, said in a phone interview.\nU.S. stocks slid the most since June yesterday as General Electric Co. (GE) , McDonald\u2019s Corp. (MCD) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) posted results that missed estimates and euro-area leaders failed to discuss aid for Spain at a European Union summit in Brussels.

The Redmond, Washington-based company cited declining sales of Windows, its flagship operating system, as the main reason for the shortfall.\nEurope\u2019s richest man, Amancio Ortega, is No. 3 on the index with a net worth of $52.4 billion, $4.6 billion ahead of Warren Buffett . The 76-year-old founder of Inditex SA (ITX) , the world\u2019s largest clothing retailer and owner of the Zara clothing chain, has gained more than $17 billion this year.\nThe fortunes of Google Inc.
