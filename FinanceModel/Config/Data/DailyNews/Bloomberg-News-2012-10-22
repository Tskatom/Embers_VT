Rising output has made Colombia the third-largest oil supplier in South America and prompted guerrillas to more than quadruple attacks on pipelines this year to deprive the state of revenue.\nEcopetrol\u2019s market value of $120.3 billion surpassed Norway \u2019s Statoil ASA (STL) and the U.K.\u2019s BG Group Plc (BG/) , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gutierrez reiterated his company\u2019s plans to produce an average of the equivalent of 780,000 barrels a day of oil this year.\nOil Auction\nSabotage probably will prevent Ecopetrol from meeting that goal, said Juan David Ballen, an analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Alianza Valores SA, which has a \u201chold\u201d on the stock.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a very difficult situation for them with all the attacks,\u201d Ballen said in a phone interview. He forecasts full-year average output of about 755,000 barrels a day.\nThe company cut its target in July from 800,000 barrels a day after sabotage rose. Attacks on pipelines quadrupled to 88 in the first seven months of 2012 from 20 in the year earlier, according to estimates by the Defense Ministry.\nColombia\u2019s oil industry is exporting more than 650,000 barrels a day as the government prepares to auction blocks this year, including unconventional energy blocks, he said.\nGutierrez later told reporters companies showing interest in such reserves in Colombia include Exxon Mobil Corp., ConocoPhillips (COP) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)\nSelling Debt\nShell is evaluating information related to the auction, Bill Tanner, a Shell spokesman, said by telephone today. ConocoPhillips was notified that it is one of the pre-qualifiers for an oil and gas leasing round in Colombia, Davy Kong, a ConocoPhillips spokeswoman, said in an e-mail today.\nPatrick McGinn, an Exxon spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement the company doesn\u2019t comment on potential opportunities. The Irving, Texas-based company holds a stake in a block in central Colombia, he said. Exxon agreed to spend as much as $50 million to explore for shale oil in Colombia with Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNE) , the latter said in an April 4 statement.\nEcopetrol will sell debt before it sells stock, and expects to issue peso- and dollar-denominated debt, Chief Financial Officer Adriana Echeverri told reporters today in New York. A debt sale will depend on next year\u2019s spending plan that will be set near year-end, she said.\nEcopetrol\u2019s third equity offering may be global, according to Echeverri. Last year, Ecopetrol raised 2.4 trillion pesos ($1.3 billion), below its target of 2.5 trillion pesos, amid a global equities rout.

The guerrilla group\u2019s attacks rose for a seventh straight year in 2011, to 2,148, according to the New Rainbow Foundation, a Bogota-based think tank that monitors the conflict.\nThe Colombian government \u201cwill maintain operations and a military presence in every centimeter of the country,\u201d Santos said.\nThe President\u2019s address came after Colombian journalist Jorge Enrique Botero told Venezuela \u2019s state-owned Telesur TV network yesterday that the government has held secret meetings with FARC envoys in Cuba since May. The meetings were also brokered by Venezuela and Norway , he said. Santos\u2019 cousin, former Vice President Francisco Santos, who is director of RCN Radio, also reported that talks had taken place.\nBotero, a reporter with a history of access to the guerrillas\u2019 senior commanders, said the FARC has agreed to meet with Santos\u2019s government in October. Botero has previously reported on Colombia\u2019s civil conflict from inside guerrilla camps, and was the only journalist to interview three American defense contractors taken hostage by the FARC after their plane crashed in Colombia\u2019s southern jungle in 2003.\nThe Doctor\nTwo senior rebels, including a member of the group\u2019s seven- man ruling secretariat known as The Doctor, were involved in the talks, according to Botero.\nThe proportion of Colombians with a favorable image of the president fell to 47 percent in July from 71 percent a year earlier, according to a poll published by Semana Magazine. Approval of his handling of security fell 23 percentage points to 36 percent, the poll found.\n\u201cAs Minister of Defense, Santos delivered the hardest blows to the guerrillas,\u201d said Claudia Lopez, an analyst at La Silla Vacia, a Colombian political website, in a telephone interview yesterday. \u201cThis is the combination of a military operation with an eventual political negotiation that\u2019s needed to find an end to the conflict.\u201d\nThe surge in guerrilla attacks is hampering Colombia \u2019s goal of increasing oil output to 1 million barrels a day from 914,000 barrels last year.\nThe rebels are targeting oil workers, pipelines and electricity pylons to try to derail what Santos says is one of the country\u2019s growth \u201clocomotives.\u201d Attacks on oil pipelines more than quadrupled to 88 in the first seven months of the year, from 20 in the same period in 2011, according to the Defense Ministry .\nOil accounted for 49 percent of Colombia\u2019s exports last year, up from 24 percent in 2007.\nSantos Popularity\nThe talks could produce \u201ca solution that doesn\u2019t please anybody,\u201d if the FARC insists on keeping some of its weapons, or the government grants immunity for people accused of crimes against humanity, said Adam Isacson , an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America .\n\u201cThe best outcome is a cease of hostilities now, and the FARC\u2019s demobilization and the delivery of as many of its members as possible,\u201d Isacson said, speaking by phone from Washington D.C. before Santos\u2019 speech.\nPeace talks could also lead to more intensive attacks on Santos from former President Alvaro Uribe and his followers, Isacson said. Uribe, who supported Santos\u2019 run for president in 2010, now attacks him continually in interviews and on his Twitter site.\nColombia\u2019s second-largest guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army, or ELN, said it is also willing to hold peace talks with the government, according to Reuters, which cited an interview with the group\u2019s leader.\nFrode Andersen, a spokesman for Norway\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs , declined to comment when called before Santos\u2019 address.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Matthew Bristow in Bogota at mbristow5@bloomberg.net ; Oscar Medina in Bogota at omedinacruz@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Joshua Goodman at jgoodman19@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:25:32", "post_time": "2012-08-28 01:00:00", "author": "Matthew Bristow , Oscar Medina", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-28/santos-confirms-colombian-government-held-talks-with-farc-rebels.html", "title": "Santos Confirms Colombian Government Held Talks With FARC Rebels", "post_date": "2012-08-28", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "COLCAP", "embers_id": "909462a25be90a75dbb67503450204c07999ffae"}, {"content": "Carrefour Gains After Selling Colombia Unit to Cencosud\nBy Matthew Bristow and Eduardo Thomson - 2012-10-19T20:11:36Z\nCarrefour SA (CA) rose in Paris while Cencosud SA (CENCOSUD) slumped the most in more than a year in Santiago after the French company agreed to sell its Colombian stores to the Chilean retailer for 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion).\nCarrefour shares rose 5.9 percent to 18.36 euros at the close of trading in Paris, the steepest advance since Aug. 30. Cencosud slid 6.2 percent, the most since August 2011, after announcing plans to sell $2.5 billion of new stock and bonds.\nThe acquisition allows Cencosud to tap rising consumer spending in Latin America as economic growth fuels an expansion of the middle class. Carrefour, the world\u2019s second-largest retailer, is selling its Colombian grocery stores as part of a strategy to exit markets it doesn\u2019t dominate.\nThe sale is \u201can incredible exit\u201d for Carrefour from a country where it first opened a store in 1998, said James Grzinic , an analyst at Jefferies International. The price was \u201cstunning\u201d and will make a \u201cvery useful dent\u201d in Carrefour\u2019s average net debt of 8 billion euros ($10 billion), he said.\nThe price is higher than for recent transactions in the food retailing industry, reflecting the potential for growth in Colombia , where the economy expanded faster than Mexico , Brazil and Argentina in the second quarter. The retail market is dominated by Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA\u2019s (CO) Almacenes Exito SA. (EXITO)\nDeal Multiple\nThe price to be paid by Santiago-based Cencosud includes debt and represents a multiple of 20 times estimated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, according to Grzinic. That compares with the 13.6 times that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) paid for control of Chile\u2019s Distribucion y Servicio D&S SA in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe median multiple for 10 takeovers of food retail businesses since 2004 is 11.9 times, the data show.\n\u201cQualitatively speaking, we think the transaction is positive\u201d for Cencosud, Alonso Aramburu, an analyst at Banco BTG Pactual SA, said in a note to clients today. The Chilean company was advised by JPMorgan Chase & Co.\nCarrefour is cutting jobs and exiting overseas markets to generate cash and cut debt as part of a three-year turnaround plan formulated by Chief Executive Officer Georges Plassat.\nThe deal \u201cindicates Plassat is prepared to sell non-core assets and the strategy is on track,\u201d said Caroline Gulliver, an analyst at Espirito Santo who rates the stock buy.\nTurkish Business\nCarrefour is also considering a combination of its Turkish business with Migros Ticaret AS, a rival supermarket chain owned by private-equity firm BC Partners Ltd., three people with knowledge of the situation said last month.\nThe retailer, based in Boulogne-Billancourt, France , also plans to exit Singapore by the end of the year and paid 220 million euros to leave Greece . It has also put Poland and Indonesia under review for possible sale.\nThe Colombia unit, which had net sales excluding gasoline of 1.5 billion euros in the 12 months through June 30, will add to Cencosud\u2019s food, home-improvement and department-store businesses in the country. Carrefour has 72 hypermarkets, 16 convenience stores and four cash-and-carry stores in Colombia.\nCarrefour, which was advised by Credit Suisse, and Cencosud didn\u2019t disclose how much of the deal comprises debt, which Espirito Santo\u2019s Gulliver estimated at 200 million euros.\nCencosud, controlled by billionaire Horst Paulmann and based in Santiago, signed a $2.5 billion credit contract with JPMorgan (JPM) to finance the transaction, which is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year.\nShare Sale\nThe Chilean retailer said it will seek shareholder approval to sell $1.5 billion in new shares. Cencosud also plans to sell $1 billion of 10-year U.S. dollar bonds, Chief Executive Officer Daniel Rodriguez and Chief Financial Officer Juan Manuel Parada told reporters today in Santiago.\nThe bonds will be sold within 90 days to tap \u201cgood\u201d market conditions, while the share sale may take place within 120 days, they said. Cencosud sees no risk of breaching debt covenants and expects its ratings to be maintained, they said.\nThe extra yield, or spread, investors demand to buy Cencosud\u2019s dollar bonds due in 2021 instead of U.S. Treasury debt rose 22 basis points, or 0.22 percentage point, today to 268 after reaching a 14-month low reached yesterday.\nColombia\u2019s consumer industry is dominated by small neighborhood shops and markets, said Mauricio Hernandez, a Bogota-based analyst at Corredores Asociados SA. This, combined with a growing economy, offers retailers a high potential return, Hernandez said.\nGrowing Economy\n\u201cChilean retailers are entering Colombia in an aggressive way,\u201d Hernandez said by telephone. \u201cIt\u2019s a market with a lot of potential, with good consumption per capita, a good economic climate and a strong outlook for growth and retail.\u201d\nColombia\u2019s retail sales rose 1.2 percent in August from the same period a year earlier, the national statistics agency said yesterday. SACI Falabella (FALAB) , Chile\u2019s largest retailer by market value, and Empresas La Polar SA (LAPOLAR) also have stores in Colombia, where Exito has a 43 percent share of the market.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an attractive market to be in, and I think it helps provide economies of scale for the company within Colombia, which is something that they were lacking,\u201d said Christopher Disalvatore, a senior analyst at IM Trust SA, in a telephone interview from Santiago.\nStill, at about 1.3 times sales, Cencosud may have paid a \u201chigh price\u201d for the Carrefour assets, Disalvatore said. The ratio is higher than the average Cencosud has paid for its previous acquisitions, he said.\nPaulmann Stake\nThe Colombian economy grew 4.9 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, faster than Mexico, which grew 4.1 percent, Brazil and Argentina. Colombia\u2019s Finance Ministry calculates the country overtook Argentina this year to become Latin America \u2019s biggest economy after Brazil and Mexico.\nCencosud is the third-biggest retailer in Latin America by sales after Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB and Brazil\u2019s Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar , data compiled by Bloomberg show. Besides Chile and Colombia, Cencosud also does business in Argentina, Peru and Brazil.\nGerman-born Paulmann, 77, sold shares in New York for the first time this year, convincing investors of his ability to navigate a global slowdown and deliver earnings growth from a company cobbled together from at least 16 acquisitions in the past decade. He\u2019s the most-active deal maker in Latin American retail, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nUnder Paulmann\u2019s command, what began as a family-run restaurant has turned into a $16 billion retail empire with 726 supermarkets, 81 home-improvement stores, 74 department stores and 25 shopping malls. Paulmann personally controls a 40 percent stake in Cencosud, with another 25 percent in the hands of family members, according to a May 25 prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Matthew Bristow in Bogota at mbristow5@bloomberg.net ; Eduardo Thomson in Santiago at ethomson1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Andrea Snyder at asnyder5@bloomberg.net\nCarrefour Rallies on Colombian Sale as Buyer Cencosud Slumps\nBalint Porneczi/Bloomberg\nCarrefour SA is cutting jobs and exiting overseas markets to generate cash and cut debt as part of a three-year turnaround plan formulated by Chief Executive Officer Georges Plassat.\nCarrefour SA is cutting jobs and exiting overseas markets to generate cash and cut debt as part of a three-year turnaround plan formulated by Chief Executive Officer Georges Plassat.

Now, she\u2019s switched to a service where she can order online and then collect her groceries from a local store.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so quick,\u201d the 25-year-old working mother said as Tesco Plc (TSCO) staff at the store in the southern English town of Harlow loaded her car trunk with goods costing 80 pounds ($127).\nWith same-store sales falling, Tesco is betting it can get a lift from shoppers like Dye by tripling the number of outlets offering what it calls click and collect. The chain\u2019s leading share of the U.K. grocery market shrunk to a seven-year low this year as more Britons chose upscale competitors such as Waitrose Ltd. or discounters like Iceland Foods Ltd. and Aldi.\nBy yearend, Tesco expects to complete collection points in 150 stores as part of a 1 billion-pound ($1.6 billion) initiative to revive domestic sales. The grocer is also hiring 20,000 staff, updating its house brand products, refreshing stores and adding more personalized promotions.\nBryan Roberts , an analyst at Kantar Retail in London, said click and collect will give shoppers a reason to choose Tesco over its competitors. Among the top four grocers in the U.K., only Wal-Mart Stores Inc.\u2019s Asda, (WMT) the No. 2 chain, has a similar service for groceries, and it\u2019s just in a trial stage. The service also helps Tesco stand out from online retailers.\n\u2018Ahead of the Pack\u2019\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a key growth opportunity,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThe economics are much superior to home delivery,\u201d which requires grocers to operate a fleet of vans and drivers.\nTesco, based in Cheshunt, England , expects that making shopping easier will convince customers to come back more often. Deloitte LLP estimates that people who shop via different methods -- the Internet, smart phones and visits to the supermarket -- spend more than double those who only shop at physical stores.\nClick and collect \u201cis gaining traction, and Tesco is ahead of the pack,\u201d said Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital who recommends holding the stock. \u201cWhile it\u2019s a very modest part of supermarket activity it is one that\u2019s expected to grow.\u201d\nWeb sales, which accounted for 3.4 percent of U.K. grocery spending last year, are set to almost double over the next five years, according to the Institute of Grocery Distribution .\nDeclining Sales\nTesco\u2019s domestic sales have declined for the last four quarters, with U.K. same-store revenue falling 1.5 percent in the 13 weeks ended May 26. That has left Chief Executive Officer Philip Clarke to seek new avenues for growth. Expanding click & collect, which started from a store in southern England two years ago, forms a part of his plan.\nThe service relies on its simplicity and convenience, said Ken Towle, Tesco\u2019s director of Internet retailing. For a 2-pound fee, a shopper\u2019s groceries are picked, packed and stored at the drive-through point. When the customer arrives, a staffer loads the groceries into the trunk.\n\u201cWhat customers like is they are in control,\u201d Towle said. \u201cThey choose when they want it to be available. It de-stresses the whole experience for them.\u201d\nThe expansion has come at a cost. Tesco has had to train staff in customer service and product returns, Towle said. And adding the collection points to stores has cut the floorspace available to sell products.\nA big challenge is linking up online orders with picking and packing the groceries in the chosen time-slot from the store, according to Chris Gates, director of retail at Hitachi Consulting, a technology adviser that has worked with Tesco. Another issue is ensuring stores can handle returns and have enough supplies to account for both online and physical buyers.\nAsda Trial\n\u201cWhilst companies realize it\u2019s the way customers want to shop, it takes a lot of investment to make it happen,\u201d Gates said. Retailers, he said, typically see a return on their investment in two years.\nAsda says it has had trouble getting planning permission to set-up drive-through collection points. The company started testing a 1.50-pound-per-order click & collect for groceries this year and has about 10 outlets. Stores with the service get about 60 to 100 orders a week almost immediately, said Jon Wragg, director of Asda\u2019s multi-channel strategy.\nThe retailer has trialed low-cost alternatives like a simple shelter in a carpark with a van that customers collect from, to a formal drive-through attached to the store.\nFrench Insight?\n\u201cIt\u2019s all the understanding and refining of the experience for customers that I think is going to be tough,\u201d Wragg said.\nFrance may offer some insight into the concept\u2019s potential. While British grocers have focused on home delivery of online orders, French companies have embraced drive-throughs instead.\nGroupe Auchan SA has had drive-in collection since 2000, and Le Clerc, Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA (CO) and Carrefour SA (CA) also now offer the service. Planet Retail estimates there were about 1,000 drive-through points in France in May. Le Clerc expects about 5 percent of its sales to come from the drive-through format by 2015, up from 1.4 percent in 2011.\nPlanet Retail analyst Malcolm Pinkerton estimates that Tesco will generate about 6.4 percent of its overall U.K. sales from online orders this year, which will surge to 9.3 percent, or 5.9 billion pounds, by 2017 as click & collect is extended.\n\u201cAnybody that\u2019s in retail who is not multi-channel would want to think quickly about having a strategy,\u201d said Colin Jeffrey, director of retail research at Deloitte Digital. Click and collect is \u201ca must, but it\u2019s a massive challenge.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Sarah Shannon in London at sshannon4@bloomberg.net .\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Celeste Perri at cperri@bloomberg.net\nTesco Sees Reversing Slump With Online Click Collection\nSimon Dawson/Bloomberg\nBy yearend, Tesco expects to complete collection points in 150 stores as part of a 1 billion-pound ($1.6 billion) initiative to revive domestic sales.\nBy yearend, Tesco expects to complete collection points in 150 stores as part of a 1 billion-pound ($1.6 billion) initiative to revive domestic sales.

Yet since Plassat took the helm on May 23, he has limited himself, publicly at least, to diagnosing the retailer\u2019s shortcomings and hinting at possible solutions.\nChange in Philosophy\nCarrefour has too much debt , costs that are too high, particularly at its head office, and an inefficient organizational structure, the CEO said June 18. The retailer may exit some countries and cede control in others where local competition is better placed after selling a stake in a Greek joint venture, he said at the time. The company said yesterday it will close two stores in Singapore .\nPlassat\u2019s brief tenure has led to \u201ca complete change in management\u2019s philosophy,\u201d according to Bernard Delattre, president of Altimeo Asset Management in Paris, who holds Carrefour shares.\n\u201cThe pragmatic person has arrived and will make pragmatic decisions to please the company and shareholders,\u201d said Delattre in a phone interview. Plassat, who \u201cvisits stores unlike Olofsson who sat in his ivory tower,\u201d understands that consumers are looking for low prices all of the time on basic items like milk or pasta, not short term promotions, he said.\nCarrefour fell 2 percent to 16 euros at the close of trading in Paris yesterday, giving the company a market value of 10.9 billion euros, down 70 percent from almost 37 billion euros at the end of 2007. The market capitalization of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world\u2019s largest retailer, has increased more than 20 percent in a similar period.\nEnormous Opportunity\nDelattre expects the French retailer to reach 25 euros to 35 euros a share eventually, though he declined to say when.\n\u201cCarrefour is losing market share every day,\u201d he said. \u201cThe day when that reverses, the stock will rebound strongly. There\u2019s an enormous opportunity in Carrefour shares.\u201d\nCarrefour may report first-half current operating income that fell to 706 million euros from 772 million euros, according to the median of four analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Twelve analysts recommend buying Carrefour shares, 13 say hold them and 14 suggest selling. The average analyst rating has improved to 2.95 out of 5 from 2.2 at the beginning of the year.\nPlassat joined Carrefour from Vivarte SA, where he turned an unprofitable shoemaker in 2000 into a company with sales of more than 3 billion euros by 2010. He earlier served as CEO of French supermarket operator Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA (CO) and ran Carrefour\u2019s Spanish business.\nWait and See\nWhile Plassat has a strong turnaround pedigree and extensive experience in grocery retailing, some investors are cautious of his prospects.\n\u201cThere is no doubt about his competence,\u201d said Amandine Gerard, president of Financiere de L\u2019Arc in Aix-en-Provence, which oversees $235 million and doesn\u2019t own Carrefour shares. \u201cBut the economic situation and improving margins will take time. It\u2019s a stock we\u2019re watching closely.\u201d\nMatthieu Giuliani, who helps manage $4 billion at Banque Palatine SA in Paris, said he isn\u2019t tempted to buy Carrefour shares after multiple failures to revive the retailer. Plassat is Carrefour\u2019s fourth CEO in eight years.\n\u201cThere have been many strategic errors,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait and see before making any bets.\u201d\nTo be sure, Plassat has acknowledged the size of the task in hand. The CEO said at a shareholder meeting in June that he needs at least three years to \u201crelaunch\u201d the ailing retailer as Europe \u2019s debt crisis weighs on consumer spending and it struggles to attract shoppers to its largest stores.\n\u201cPlassat is a positive electroshock for the market and for employees,\u201d said Emmanuel Soupre, who helps oversee $5.5 billion including Carrefour shares at Neuflize Private Assets in Paris. \u201cThere haven\u2019t yet been big changes, but the market has come back to the shares because it is giving credit to Plassat.

Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar, Brazil \u2019s biggest retailer,  said profit more than doubled in the second quarter, benefiting from gains in the company\u2019s real estate business and beating analysts\u2019 estimates.\nPao de Acucar\u2019s net income attributable to controlling shareholders was 255 million reais ($125 million) in the quarter, compared with 91 million reais a year earlier, according to a regulatory filing sent late yesterday. That compares with an average estimate for adjusted profit of 143.5 million reais among six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net income excluding the company\u2019s property business rose 75 percent to 159 million reais, according to a separate filing today.\nBrazilian consumers, whose spending has powered economic growth, have been supported by a strong labor market even as job creation slows. The unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in May, a record low for the month. In the same month, the economy created 139,679 jobs, 45 percent fewer than a year earlier.\nPao de Acucar\u2019s margin on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose to 6.5 percent in the quarter, from 5.7 percent a year earlier. Sales increased by 6.8 percent to 12 billion reais in the period.\nPao de Acucar yesterday named Christophe Hidalgo as chief financial officer, according to a regulatory filing. The company will keep its 1.8 billion reais investment guidance for 2012, Chief Executive Officer Eneas Pestana said in a call with investors.\nPao de Acucar\u2019s shares fell 2.2 percent to 76.98 reais at 12:27 p.m. in Sao Paulo while the benchmark Bovespa index dropped 0.3 percent.\nBillionaire Abilio Diniz handed control of the retailer founded by his father to Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA on June 22.

Morgan Ventures Energy Corp. FERC opened the probe in August after complaints from California and Midwest grid operators that JPMorgan\u2019s bidding practices were abusive, according to the agency\u2019s initial court filing.\nThe case is Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v.

The body should, at a minimum, supervise banks in all 17 countries that use the single currency, he said.\n\u201cI think it will need to cover all banks, of course,\u201d Barnier told lawmakers in the European Parliament\u2019s economic and monetary affairs committee. Responsibilities could be delegated to national regulators through decentralization, he said.\nEuro leaders said on June 29 that it\u2019s \u201cimperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.\u201d To this end, they said that once a single supervisor, involving the European Central Bank , is established, the euro area\u2019s permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, could recapitalize banks directly.\nLeaders called on the European Commission to present proposals for a single bank supervisor \u201cshortly.\u201d Barnier said the commission will unveil its plan in September.\nEuropean Banks Able to Meet Capital Targets, Bank Watchdog Says\nEuropean banks reached a target of raising 114.7 billion euros ($141 billion) in fresh capital by the end of June, according to a European Union document.\nThe \u201ccapital shortfall\u201d has \u201cbeen largely raised from private sources and where necessary public backstops were activated,\u201d according to a memorandum prepared for EU finance ministers for a Brussels meeting today that was obtained by Bloomberg News.\nThe European Banking Authority told lenders to meet a core Tier-1 capital ratio of 9 percent by the end of June, and hold additional reserves, called a sovereign buffer, against the debt of weaker euro-area countries, based upon the market price of the bonds. The measures were part of a response to the sharp fall in the value of securities issued by euro-area governments.\n\u201cThe EBA exercise was a necessary step on the road to repair banks\u2019 balance sheets and strengthen their capital base,\u201d the document said. \u201cThe recommendation will remain in force until the normalization of risks.\u201d\nA preliminary report will be released tomorrow, according to the document, with more detailed results to be published in September.\nFranca Rosa Congiu, a spokeswoman for the EBA in London , didn\u2019t immediately return a telephone voice-mail message seeking comment.\nTucker Says No Public Official Told Him to Lean on Barclays\nBank of England Deputy Governor Paul Tucker said no government minister or official pressured him to instruct Barclays Plc (BARC) or any other U.K. commercial bank to lowball its Libor submissions during the financial crisis.\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Tucker told lawmakers in London yesterday, when asked if anybody from the civil service or the then Labour government leaned on him to ask banks to lower their Libor submissions. He also said some of a memo written by former Barclays Chief Executive Officer Robert Diamond after an October 2008 phone call between the two gave \u201cthe wrong impression.\u201d\nTucker\u2019s two-hour testimony followed the record 290 million-pound ($449 million) fine imposed on Barclays last month for manipulation of the London interbank offered rate. The scandal, which Tucker described as a \u201ccesspit,\u201d has jeopardized his position as the front-runner to replace Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England.\nFor more, click here.\nCompliance Action\nVivendi Reviews Due as Agency Toughens Policing of Mergers\nFrance \u2019s Antitrust Authority will decide by July 24 whether to approve the revised union of Vivendi SA (VIV) \u2019s Canal Plus pay- television unit with Television Par Satellite, its chief said yesterday.\nThe regulator in September canceled the 2006 deal after finding that Canal Plus hadn\u2019t met all the conditions imposed to ensure the merger didn\u2019t harm competition.\nRegulators in the deal are seeking diversity in the pay-TV industry, a greater range of packages for consumers, and steps that don\u2019t \u201cdestabilize\u201d the film industry , Bruno Lasserre, the agency\u2019s chief, said yesterday in Paris. The regulator won\u2019t require the company to sell off its CanalSat distribution arm, he said.\nThe Authority has taken a tough stand on merger approval since 2009, when it took responsibility for authorizing deals from the finance ministry . So far this year, it has imposed conditions on seven deals, the same number as in 2011 and 2010 combined. The regulator has also fined companies for not living up to the conditions of merger authorizations.\nIts cancellation of the Vivendi merger was the first time the Authority has done so for failure to comply with terms. The authority also imposed a 30 million-euro ($37 million) fine on Canal Plus.\nSpokesmen for Vivendi, Canal Plus and Bigard didn\u2019t immediately return calls seeking comment on the regulator\u2019s actions.\nJapan Checking Possible Insider Trading of ANA, Official Says\nJapan \u2019s securities watchdog is examining possible insider trading of All Nippon Airways Co. (9202) shares before last week\u2019s announcement of a public offering, a government official with direct knowledge of the matter said.\nThe Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission is studying share movements before the July 3 announcement and will conduct hearings to determine whether underwriters leaked information, said the official, who requested anonymity as the investigation is private.\nJapanese regulators are cracking down on insider trading after finding that employees of firms including Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) tipped off clients about share sales they managed in 2010. Moody\u2019s Investors Service said such leaks may be \u201cmore than a rare occurrence\u201d and the loss of confidence from the scandal will damage local securities firms.\nTrading volume of All Nippon Airways shares reached a three-month high the day before news of the 211 billion yen ($2.6 billion) issuance became public, led by short-selling, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The moves were \u201cunnatural,\u201d ANA spokesman Ryosei Nomura said on July 6.\nANA\u2019s Nomura said the airline currently has no plan to take action after receiving assurances from the four underwriters -- Nomura Holdings, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) -- that they didn\u2019t leak information.\nSpokesmen at the four banks declined to comment. An SESC spokesman who asked not to be named also declined to comment, saying he wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss individual companies with the media. ANA spokeswoman Megumi Tezuka said the carrier is unaware of the regulator\u2019s examination.\nANA, Japan\u2019s biggest carrier, announced its share sale at 4 p.m. on July 3. Investors traded 24 million ANA shares on the previous day, the most since March 27, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock declined as much as 2.7 percent on July 2 before closing 0.9 percent lower, while the benchmark Topix Index dropped 0.1 percent.\nFor more, click here.\nLawsuits\nDendreon, Prostate Drug Maker, Sued Over 2011 Stock Drop\nDendreon Corp. (DNDN) , the maker of the prostate-cancer medicine Provenge, was sued by an investor claiming the company withheld information about sales that led to a 2011 share price drop .\nCompany officers and directors misused proprietary information about Provenge, which costs $93,000 per therapy cycle, by not revealing that doctors were reluctant to prescribe it because they had to pay up front and may have trouble getting reimbursed from Medicaid or private insurers, Investor Herbert Silverberg claims.\nThe reimbursement issue was \u201ca consistent topic of concern internally,\u201d while officials \u201ctouted lofty goals\u201d for the drug, according to the Delaware Chancery Court complaint filed yesterday in Wilmington.\nProvenge was approved in the U.S. in 2010 as the first therapy designed to train the body\u2019s immune system to attack cancer cells as if they were a virus.\nThe following year, the company \u201cacknowledged that acceptance of Provenge would be a much more gradual process,\u201d than first thought, according to the complaint. Dendreon shares fell 67 percent, from $35.84 on Aug. 3 to $11.69 the next day, plaintiff\u2019s lawyers contend.\nIn the so-called derivative lawsuit, Silverberg asks a judge to award damages from officials to the company, \u201cdisgorgement of all profits\u201d from wrongdoing and positive corporate governance provisions to protect shareholders in the future.\n\u201cWhile it is our practice not to comment on litigation, we believe this suit is baseless and without merit,\u201d Lindsay Rocco, a spokeswoman for Dendreon, said in an e-mailed message.\nThe case is Silverberg v.

The Brazilian company\u2019s sales may increase 13 percent this year, according to the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, while Casino\u2019s revenue is forecast to grow 19 percent.\nInvestors are speculating that 75-year-old Diniz won\u2019t take to his diminished role as chairman and will decide to leave the company that his father, a Portuguese immigrant, founded as a bakery in 1948, said Daniella Maia, the chief analyst at Ativa Corretora in Rio de Janeiro.\nManagement Style\n\u201cWhat will really impact the minority shareholders is if Diniz leaves for good,\u201d Maia said. \u201cHis management style and ability to understand the retail sector added value.\u201d\nDiniz has the right to continue being Pao de Acucar\u2019s chairman \u201cas long as the company delivers good results and he is in good mental and physical health,\u201d according to the shareholders\u2019 agreement.\nPao de Acucar gained 12 percent in the 12 months through yesterday, as Casino slumped 2.5 percent. The Brazilian retailer has almost doubled in the past five years, as Casino fell 9.8 percent.\nThe shares were the best performer on the MSCI Consumer Staples Index today after the Folha de S.Paulo report that Casino plans to convert Pao de Acucar\u2019s preferred shares to common shares so it can list the stock on the Novo Mercado section, which has stricter requirements on disclosure and minority shareholders\u2019 rights. Casino has no such plans at the moment, according to a press officer who asked not to be identified because of company policy.\nStrategy Outlook\nSome investors may also be betting that Pao de Acucar will continue to grow under new management.\n\u201cThe company\u2019s business should continue to be carried out in the same way, seeking to generate value for the shareholder,\u201d said Leonardo Zanfelicio, an analyst at brokerage Concordia Corretora. \u201cIt looks like there won\u2019t be any big strategy change, which has been pretty successful, and the group posted big growth in past years.\u201d\nCasino bought 24 percent of voting shares in Wilkes Participacoes SA, the entity that controls Pao de Acucar, in 1999. Six years later, the French company increased its stake to 34 percent in an agreement that gave it the option to buy control of the Brazilian company.\nLast year, Diniz teamed up with billionaire banker Andre Esteves , the chief executive officer of Sao Paulo-based Banco BTG Pactual SA, as part of a proposal to merge Pao de Acucar with the Brazilian unit of Carrefour SA. (CA) The tie-up was to be financed in part by Brazil\u2019s development bank, BNDES.\n\u2018The Frenchman\u2019\nCasino described the proposal as hostile, filed a complaint against its Brazilian partner and denounced the move as illegal and in violation of the 2005 shareholders agreement. Casino increased its stake in the retailer to more than 40 percent and on May 15 announced its plan to exercise the option to become the sole controlling shareholder.\nDiniz, a Catholic who attends Mass every week, said earlier that month that he was asking for God\u2019s help to solve the dispute, O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper reported at the time.\n\u201cHelp me solve the problem with the Frenchman,\u201d Diniz said at an event in Sao Paulo , according to the newspaper.\nDiniz declined to comment. Press officials at Pao de Acucar and Casino also declined to comment.\nDintz said today at the shareholders meeting that he will ask the company\u2019s new management to \u201cnot forget that this is a family company.\u201d\n\u201cMy mission is the relentless defense of the group,\u201d he said. \u201cI will do everything in order to have our principles and values respected.\u201d\nSeven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg rate the stock hold, while 14 say buy and none recommend selling.\nCasino is taking control of Brazil\u2019s largest retailer as economic growth in France stalls. While Brazil is forecast to grow 2.3 percent this year, according to a central bank survey of economists published June 18, France \u2019s economy may expand just 0.3 percent, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\nThe French market \u201cis very developed, without much space for growth,\u201d Maia said. \u201cCompetitors are well-established.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Fabiola Moura in Sao Paulo at fdemoura@bloomberg.net ; Denyse Godoy in Sao Paulo at dgodoy2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Helder Marinho at hmarinho@bloomberg.net Jessica Brice at jbrice1@bloomberg.net\nBillionaire Abilio Diniz\nFabio Guinalz/FotoArena/LatinContent/Getty Images\nBillionaire Abilio Diniz is handing control of Brazil\u2019s biggest retailer to Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA as the stock posts the biggest losses among peers in Sao Paulo.\nBillionaire Abilio Diniz is handing control of Brazil\u2019s biggest retailer to Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA as the stock posts the biggest losses among peers in Sao Paulo.

(WMT) \u2019s efforts to acquire Latin American assets from Carrefour SA (CA) are slowing as the French retailer focuses on turning around its European business, said people familiar with the matter.\nWal-Mart has pressed Carrefour to sell stores in Colombia and also Brazil , said the people, who declined to be identified as the negotiations were private. Carrefour\u2019s Colombian unit generated 1.69 billion euros ($2.11 billion) in sales last year.\nWal-Mart is targeting stores overseas as revenue abroad climbs at 10 times the pace of U.S. sales. Doug McMillon, head of Wal-Mart\u2019s international business, said last month the retailer is open to purchases in Japan and Latin America , and signaled that Colombia could be a possible site of expansion.\n\u201cWal-Mart is realizing that the best strategy is buying something\u201d rather than building something new, Bryan Gildenberg, an analyst with Kantar Retail, said in a telephone interview yesterday. \u201c Colombia is a growing market and Wal-Mart isn\u2019t there.\u201d\nWal-Mart and Carrefour have held on-and-off negotiations for more than two years, with Wal-Mart initiating many of the talks, said one of the people. After some conversations this year, Carrefour has slowed the pace of talks as it deals with deteriorating conditions in Europe , according to this person.\nWhile Wal-Mart remains interested in the operations, no deal is imminent, said two of these people. A spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for Boulogne-Billancourt, France-based Carrefour.\nWal-Mart rose less than 1 percent to $67.72 at the close in New York yesterday.\nInternational Performance\nWal-Mart\u2019s international sales climbed 15 percent in the year ended Jan. 31 to $125.9 billion, compared with a 1.5 percent increase for the U.S. operations.\nCarrefour is in the midst of cost cuts to improve its performance in France , its largest market. Hypermarket same- store sales there sank 3.1 percent last quarter , excluding gasoline and currency moves. Shoppers are abandoning those types of stores as they seek out more convenient options, like smaller local shops and online retailers.\nCarrefour\u2019s Brazilian business may have a value of 5 billion euros to 7 billion euros, according to estimates from Caroline Gulliver, an analyst at Execution Noble in London.\nCarrefour\u2019s Colombia division is second in retail market share in the country, behind French rival Casino Guichard- Perrachon SA, according to Kantar. If Wal-Mart acquired the business, it may take a few years to integrate it and take advantage of growth in the market, said Mark Baum, managing partner of Marcat Group LLC, a consulting company in Washington, D.C.\n\u201cIt follows Wal-Mart\u2019s Latin American strategy,\u201d Baum said in a phone interview. \u201cIf they are investing for the long haul it could work, but there won\u2019t be an immediate return.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: David Welch in Detroit at dwelch12@bloomberg.net ; Jeffrey McCracken in New York at jmccracken3@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Robin Ajello at rajello@bloomberg.net\nWal-Mart Efforts to Buy Carrefour Assets Said to Have Slowed\nRich Press/Bloomberg\nTropical plants adorn the exterior of a Carrefour SA outlet in the Barra de Tijuca neighborhood of Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.\nTropical plants adorn the exterior of a Carrefour SA outlet in the Barra de Tijuca neighborhood of Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.

(C) and Arion Capital to advise on a plan to buy out Cia Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar in retailer Via Varejo SA (VVAR3) for as much as 3.5 billion reais ($1.71 billion), two people familiar with the matter said.\nSamuel Klein and his son Michael have a 47 percent stake in Sao Caetano do Sul-based Via Varejo, which has a market value of 6.2 billion reais, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Kleins have informed Pao de Acucar of their plan to make an offer for its 52 percent stake in Via Varejo, said one of the people, who asked to not be named because the plans haven\u2019t been announced.\nBooming consumer demand in Brazil has made billionaires of Samuel Klein, a Polish immigrant and Holocaust survivor, and his son. In 2010, Samuel Klein sold a stake in his chain of home- appliance stores, Casas Bahia Comercial Ltda., to Pao de Acucar. The combination resulted in Via Varejo.\nThe Kleins are considering making an offer for Via Varejo after France \u2019s Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA (CO) exercises its option to became the sole controlling shareholder of Pao de Acucar on June 22, one of people said.\nMichael Klein has spoken with Pao de Acucar Chairman Abilio Diniz and Casino about the acquisition, Veja magazine reported on May 12.\nA representative for Klein in Sao Paulo who asked not to be named said no talks are under way.

The funds known as Afores, barred from such investments since the system was privatized in 1997, allocated most of their holdings to Mexican debt markets.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen globally a great deal of interest in this phase\u201d when pension funds start to invest in commodities, Philippe J.J.

Alcoa Chief Executive Officer Klaus Kleinfeld qualified Brazilian energy costs as \u201cunbelievably high\u201d in a May 4 speech, after the New York-based aluminum producer said in a March statement it was considering cutting output in the country.\nPresident Dilma Rousseff is forcing utilities in Brazil, where companies pay more than double U.S. and Chinese electricity prices, to cut rates by as much as 28 percent in a bid to stoke economic growth and make companies more competitive. The reductions will be a requirement for utilities renewing operating licenses through 2017.\n\u201cThis is a historic decision by the government and the right step at an important time for the Brazilian industry,\u201d Augusto Espeschit de Almeida, chief executive officer for Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal (MT) \u2019s long steel businesses in South America, said in e-mailed comments. The government \u201chas taken important decisions to improve the competitiveness of the industry,\u201d he said.\nMelbourne-based BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Vale SA (VALE5) , the world\u2019s largest mining companies, and ArcelorMittal, the top steelmaker, are among the biggest clients of utilities such as Belo Horizonte , Brazil-based Cia. Energetica de Minas Gerais , the country\u2019s No. 1 power company by market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u2018Encouraged\u2019\nA 28 percent cut in electricity rates would reduce average fixed costs for Brazilian materials makers and manufacturers by 4 percent, according to the Brasilia-based national industry confederation.\n\u201cAlcoa is encouraged by the measures adopted by the Brazilian government for reducing electricity costs to help industries remain competitive,\u201d spokeswoman Libby Archell said in an e-mailed response to questions.\nBrazilian utility shares dropped an average 6.8 percent last week, the industry\u2019s second-biggest loss in 82 countries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Cia. Energetica de Sao Paulo , Brazil\u2019s second-largest power generator by capacity, sank 28 percent the day after the announcement, its biggest drop since its initial public offering in August 2006. Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) , the Rio de Janeiro-based state-run utility, was also among utilities that led losses on Brazil\u2019s benchmark Bovespa (IBOV) index on the same day.\n\u2018Competitiveness Problem\u2019\n\u201cThe government\u2019s attitude acknowledging there is a competitiveness problem is highly positive,\u201d said Adjarma Azevedo, president of the Brazilian Aluminum Association , an industry group that represents companies including Alcoa and Oslo-based Norsk Hydro ASA (NHY) , Europe\u2019s third-largest aluminum maker.\nThe group will meet next week to discuss the benefits of the measures after energy costs discouraged investments in past years, Azevedo said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo . The metal used in airplanes and consumer appliances is among the most energy-intensive industries in the world.\nVale, based in Rio de Janeiro , has bought energy assets in past years to reduce costs and has nine Brazilian hydroelectric plants to support its mining operations. Last year it agreed to buy a 9 percent stake in Norte Energia SA, the group that is building the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam in the Amazon. It has also turned to palm-tree oil and wind turbines to insulate earnings from surging energy rates that represented 13 percent of its costs last year.\n\u2018Stupefied Faces\u2019\nFor utilities, Rousseff\u2019s measures announced at an event with industry leaders in Brasilia on Sept. 11 mean profits will likely decline, Banco Itau SA analysts led by Marcos Severine said in a note to clients the day after.\nThe event was \u201cmarked by the speechless, stupefied faces of sector specialists and company executives,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cWe see relevant downside potential to our earnings\u201d estimates, the analysts said.\nBrazilian companies pay on average about 329 reais ($163) per megawatt-hour, Firjan said in its report. Even with a 28 percent discount, the costs would still be higher than in India , China and Russia , the biggest emerging-market economies along with Brazil , according to Firjan data.\n\u201cThis measure is a first step,\u201d Tatiana Lauria, an industrial competitiveness specialist at Firjan, said in a phone interview from Rio. \u201cThere is still a lot of uncertainty about how it will be done and exactly what charges will be reduced in some cases. We imagine the impact will start to be felt next year and will be fully felt by 2015.\u201d\nOther Costs\nCompanies operating in Brazil are also less competitive than emerging-market peers because of other costs such as transportation infrastructure and taxes, Chris Garman, head of Latin American research at the Eurasia Group, said in a phone interview from New York.\n\u201cThe cost of energy in Brazil is high by any standard among emerging markets ,\u201d Garman said. \u201cThis is a measure that does increase the competitiveness of the Brazilian industry. That said, it\u2019s not as if this is sufficient to turn the corner.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Rodrigo Orihuela in Rio de Janeiro at rorihuela@bloomberg.net ; Juan Pablo Spinetto in Rio de Janeiro at jspinetto@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Adriana Arai at aarai1@bloomberg.net\nUtilities Pain Is Alcoa Gain in Rousseff Plan\nAdriano Machado/Bloomberg\nA 28 percent cut in electricity rates would reduce average fixed costs for Brazilian materials makers and manufacturers by 4 percent, according to the Brasilia-based national industry confederation.\nA 28 percent cut in electricity rates would reduce average fixed costs for Brazilian materials makers and manufacturers by 4 percent, according to the Brasilia-based national industry confederation.

(FNFG) for about $1 billion.\n\u201cThe revenue synergy and the revenue target are encouraging as it suggests that HSBC\u2019s cost-efficiency effort is not just focusing on reducing costs,\u201d Sandy Mehta, CEO of Hong Kong-based Value Investment Principals Ltd., said by telephone today. \u201cThat\u2019s a fine balance.\u201d\nThe bank has increased its estimate for potential additional revenue from integrating its four global businesses in the \u201cshort to medium term\u201d by $1 billion, Gulliver said in the statement. HSBC said a year ago it would encourage greater cooperation among its investment and commercial banking units to create $1 billion in extra revenue.\nROE Target Raised\nThe bank will exit four markets in Latin America and change its model in another four, concentrating on the \u201cpriority markets\u201d of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico .\nHSBC said a year ago it would target a return on equity of 12 percent to 15 percent. That compares with 11 percent in 2011. The bank also said it would seek to reduce costs to a range of 48 percent to 52 percent of revenue. That measure stood at 56 percent at the end of March.\nIn April, 27 percent of Barclays Plc (BARC) \u2019s shareholders voted against CEO Robert Diamond\u2019s 12 million-pound ($19 million) compensation package. HSBC, which will have its annual meeting on May 25, has tried to align its executive pay with shareholder interests, Gulliver said. His long-term bonus is deferred for five years, paid in HSBC stock and is inaccessible until his retirement, he said.\n\u201cWe think we are in a slightly different situation than some,\u201d he said.\nThe bank was criticized on May 15 by Pensions & Investment Research Consultants Ltd., a shareholder adviser, for the reliability and audit quality of its accounts, which may be affected by the International Financial Reporting Standards. Shareholders should vote down the audit report, PIRC said.\nUsing the standards is required by regulators, Finance Director Iain Mackay said on today\u2019s conference call. \u201cTo object to a set of international standards is an interesting point of view, but it is simply not a basis on which to recommend that the accounts are not approved.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Howard Mustoe in London at hmustoe@bloomberg.net ; Stephanie Tong in Hong Kong at stong17@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Edward Evans at eevans3@bloomberg.net\nHSBC Expects to Meet Top End of Savings Goal at $3.5B\nChris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg\nHSBC's Canary Wharf offices, right, in London.\nHSBC's Canary Wharf offices, right, in London.

2012-10-22T04:01:00Z\nCrescent Point Energy Corp. (CPG) , the most acquisitive of Canadian energy companies this year, is searching for U.S. buying opportunities as far afield as Texas to increase oil production.\nAfter spending $2 billion for smaller operators and land near the Calgary-based company\u2019s Saskatchewan and Alberta light- oil fields, Crescent Point is seeking targets to ply its \u201ctechnical expertise\u201d in the U.S. and help boost its output 44 percent by 2017, Chief Executive Officer Scott Saxberg said.\nCrescent Point employees in Denver are looking for assets across the continent, Saxberg, 44, said in an Oct. 18 interview in his Calgary office.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more opportunities than there are dollars chasing them,\u201d in the U.S., he said. \u201cIn Texas, there are more assets for sale than any other time.\u201d\nThe company, Canada\u2019s seventh-biggest oil and natural gas producer by market value, could tap equity markets for acquisition funding as oil prices have recovered since June, while not neglecting another 20 years of drilling on existing acreage, Saxberg said.\nCrescent Point\u2019s six Canadian energy purchases this year top four acquisitions by Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) and three by Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , figures compiled by Bloomberg show.\nCrescent Point\u2019s experience using horizontal drilling to discover new fields in Western Canada and coaxing oil from reservoirs with water floods give it an edge in the U.S., Saxberg said, declining to identify areas of interest.\nNorth Dakota\n\u201cWe\u2019re always looking for opportunities, so on a macro basis for our company, we\u2019re still continuing to consolidate in our main core areas and look for that new area,\u201d Saxberg said. The company plans to lift oil production , 90 percent of output, to 137,000 barrels a day in five years, from 95,000, he said.\nA North Dakota expansion could be strategic for Crescent Point, and the proximity to its Saskatchewan operations might comfort investors, said Gordon Currie of Salman Partners.\n\u201cGoing to Texas and the offshore Gulf of Mexico , that would be a stretch,\u201d Currie, an analyst who rates the company a buy and doesn\u2019t own the shares, said in a phone interview from Calgary.\nCrescent Point moved into North Dakota in 2010, acquiring more than 85,000 acres in the Bakken and Three Forks formations, according to the company\u2019s website.\nThe foothold in the state is \u201cpretty small\u201d relative to the company\u2019s position in the southeast Saskatchewan Bakken and Shaunavon in the province\u2019s west, Saxberg said. Crescent Point has kept North Dakota drilling low in a high-cost environment set to deflate as competitors slow activity, he said.\nAsset Purchases\nCrescent Point picked up Calgary-based oil and gas companies Wild Stream Exploration Inc., Cutpick Energy Inc. and Reliable Energy Ltd. and made three other asset purchases this year to expand in Western Canada , many of the deals having taken several years to develop, Saxberg said.\nThe company now controls 95 percent of the Shaunavon area and 80 percent of the Saskatchewan Bakken, he said.\nWilling investors allow Crescent Point to pay \u201chealthy prices,\u201d regularly over $100,000 a flowing barrel, Currie said. The company issued no debt to make acquisitions this year and raised about C$1.24 billion ($1.25 billion) in two equity issues.\n\u201cThey\u2019re simultaneously the most acquisition-oriented company in their peer group but also pretty liberal with equity,\u201d Currie said. \u201cThe market\u2019s pretty happy with what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\nCrescent Point rose 93 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange in the five years through Oct. 19, compared with a 17 percent drop for the Standard & Poor\u2019s/TSX Energy Index. Crescent Point has lagged this year, falling 4.7 percent, while the energy index is little changed.\nDividend Yield\nThe company has a dividend yield of 6.5 percent, and the highest rate of reinvestment among its peers, with 57 percent of dividends declared in 2011 reinvested, Currie said. It ranks No. 11 in dividend yield among companies in the index.\nAmong analysts rating the stock, 17 recommend to buy, five advise to hold and one suggests selling. Crescent Point is scheduled to release third-quarter results on Nov. 8, when it is projected to report profit excluding one-time items of C$36.2 million, or 11 Canadian cents a share, based on average analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nInvestors remain \u201cvery supportive\u201d of Crescent Point, but there\u2019s a limit to how much equity the company can issue, said Mason Granger, who manages C$500 million at Sentry Investments Inc. in Toronto, with Crescent Point as a \u201ccore\u201d holding.\n\u201cFrom time to time, I feel like there\u2019s deal fatigue,\u201d Granger said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey issue paper a lot.\u201d\n\u2018Different\u2019 Game\nTrent Stangl, a Crescent Point spokesman, didn\u2019t return a telephone call and e-mail on Oct. 19 seeking comment.\nSaxberg will probably buy in the U.S. next, with fewer large targets left in western Canada, Granger said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whole different ball game on the U.S. side and transaction multiples have been pretty high,\u201d he said. \u201cCan they make that work?\u201d\nCrescent Point\u2019s biggest challenge is \u201cnot getting too carried away,\u201d Saxberg said. \u201cNot going too fast too hard, not driving costs up and maintaining a good growth rate and a good development strategy and not overdoing it,\u201d he said.\nThe company is one of the most \u201cproactive\u201d companies in Calgary to hedge oil prices to reduce risk, Currie said. \u201cThese guys are very good about it,\u201d Currie said. \u201cThey do it two or three years out in the future.\u201d\nInvestments to connect Crescent Point\u2019s Saskatchewan fields to rail lines that began three years ago are paying off, Saxberg said.\nAs pipeline bottlenecks depressed Canadian crude prices in the second quarter, the company was making C$10 a barrel more moving oil by rail to eastern Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, he said. Crescent Point is doubling its rail capacity, a \u201csafety valve\u201d against pipeline disruptions, he said, to 45,000 barrels a day this year.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Rebecca Penty in Calgary at rpenty@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Susan Warren at susanwarren@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:26:10", "post_time": "2012-10-22 00:01:00", "author": "Rebecca Penty", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-22/crescent-point-purchases-to-extend-to-u-s-.html", "title": "Crescent Point Purchases to Extend to U.S.", "post_date": "2012-10-22", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "COLCAP", "embers_id": "62d0a3068e478113608732fca6965dbcabca977a"}, {"content": "Pacific Rubiales Buys 35% Stake in Karoon\u2019s Brazilian Fields\nBy James Paton - 2012-09-19T02:59:21Z\nPacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , which operates Colombia\u2019s largest oil field, agreed to buy a 35 percent stake in exploration blocks owned by Karoon Gas Australia Ltd. (KAR) off the coast of Brazil.\nBogota-based Pacific Rubiales will pay $40 million in cash and fund as much as $210 million in exploration costs, Mt. Martha, Victoria-based Karoon said today in a statement. The drilling in the Santos Basin is set to begin in mid-November, Executive Chairman Robert Hosking said in a phone interview.\n\u201cA large amount of equity is being retained by Karoon for the up-and-coming drilling campaign,\u201d Hosking said. \u201cWe can leverage off the equity in project development in the future.\u201d\nThe deal with Pacific Rubiales follows the scrapping of Karoon\u2019s proposed initial public offering of its South American business in November 2010. The Australian company is a partner with Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the state-controlled oil company known as Petrobras, in the Maruja discovery.\nKaroon advanced as much as 10.8 percent to A$5.64 in Sydney trading, the highest since May 8. The shares were up 7.5 percent at 12:50 p.m. local time, compared with a 0.3 percent increase in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.\nKaroon is targeting a potential resource of 100 million to 300 million barrels of oil in each of the three wells in Brazil, Hosking said.

(PRE) plans to increase production next year from an oil block in Colombia near the nation\u2019s largest crude field as the government eases permitting delays.\nThe CPE-6 block may produce \u201csome\u201d barrels of crude this year once the company receives an environmental license as soon as this month, Chief Executive Officer Ronald Pantin said yesterday in an interview in Cartagena, Colombia. Output at CPE- 6 may rise to 15,000 barrels a day next year and 120,000 barrels by the end of 2014, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something easy to develop,\u201d Pantin said.\nThe government is speeding permitting, aiding production increases, Pantin said. Colombia, South America \u2019s third-largest crude supplier, is trying to reduce delays that threaten to derail national production targets, oil regulator Orlando Cabrales said in June.\nPacific Rubiales gained 4.8 percent to C$23.58 at the close in Toronto, after advancing as much as 5.6 percent.\nProduction from the Rubiales field, the nation\u2019s largest, will climb to 190,000 barrels a day at year-end from about 172,000 barrels a day now, after regulators awarded a water- injection permit, Pantin said yesterday on a conference call with analysts. Pacific owns the field with Ecopetrol SA. (ECOPETL)\nAcquisitions\nA drop in shares of some oil producers amid a \u201ccredit crunch\u201d has created opportunities for acquisitions, Pantin said. Pacific Rubiales last month finished its purchase of Petromagdalena Energy Corp., which also produces crude in Colombia.\nPacific Rubiales is increasing reserves through exploration, including at CPE-6, where the company began searching for crude in 2008, Pantin said. Pacific Rubiales owns the venture with Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)\nColombian output slid to 929,200 barrels a day in July from 934,000 barrels a day in June, according to the government, which targets nationwide output of 1 million barrels a day this year.

(C) , saying he helped position the bank for further growth.\n\u201cMany companies like HSBC, Barclays (BARC) and Standard Chartered (STAN) shrank and went back to their roots,\u201d Alwaleed, the largest individual investor in Citigroup, said today at a conference in Dubai. \u201cCitigroup never blinked on that. It\u2019s the only global bank at the moment and really the potential is there,\u201d 57-year- old Alwaleed said, adding that Pandit did a \u201cgood\u201d job as CEO.\nCitigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank, said Oct. 16 that Michael Corbat , 52, was picked to lead the New York-based company after Pandit\u2019s resignation. The former CEO wasn\u2019t a good fit because of his lack of experience in more traditional banking, according to Sheila Bair, who clashed with him when she was chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\nPandit oversaw the recovery of a bank that was saddled with losses and distressed assets accumulated before he became CEO, and in May 2008 he announced plans for about $400 billion of divestments within three years. As the credit crunch turned into a full-blown crisis Citigroup began accepting federal help. The dividend was cut to 1 cent, and Pandit reduced his own salary to $1, vowing to keep it there until the bank became profitable.\nCitigroup \u2018Weakness\u2019\nCitigroup\u2019s \u201cweakness\u201d under Pandit was related to dealing with regulators, Alwaleed said today. The Saudi prince said policies under Corbat would continue, citing a company conference call.\nAlwaleed, whose 95 percent stake in Saudi investment company Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM) makes up more than half of his fortune, told German newspaper Handelsblatt in May that he doesn\u2019t plan to expand investment in banks beyond Citigroup.\nGlobal banks including HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and Barclays Bank Plc are grappling with a European debt crisis now in its fourth year and uncertainty as the U.S. faces a fiscal cliff in early 2013, when automatic tax increases and budget cuts are set to siphon billions of dollars of purchasing power from the economy.\nCitigroup directors ousted Pandit after concluding his mismanagement of operations caused setbacks with regulators and cost credibility with investors, a person with knowledge of the discussions said last week. His departure came just a day after third-quarter results beat analysts\u2019 estimates.\nCitigroup\u2019s $2.9 billion writedown on the Smith Barney brokerage unit and a two-level cut of its credit rating by Moody\u2019s Investors Service contributed to Pandit\u2019s replacement, a person with knowledge of the discussions said last week.\nNet Income\nThird-quarter net income was $468 million, or 15 cents a share, from $3.77 billion, or $1.23, a year earlier. Including one-time items, analysts estimated a loss of $777 million.\nAlwaleed\u2019s estimated net worth is $23.1 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That makes him the 18th richest person in the world, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows. His personal possessions include palaces, private jets, jewelry and a super yacht. Notable gifts include a donation of $20 million to Harvard University and $17 million to the United Nations .\nThe billionaire also said today he\u2019s sticking with his investment in Apple Inc.

(C) Chairman Richard Parsons, who in 2011 awarded Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit a retention package valued at about $40 million, said the CEO\u2019s departure last week was \u201cappropriate.\u201d\n\u201cYou need seasoned, honed managers who can cause a 250,000, 300,000-personnel organization to march\u201d with direction, Parsons said in a weekend interview at his Tuscan vineyard in Montalcino, Italy . \u201cVikram will tell you, \u2018That\u2019s not my bag.\u2019\u201d\nPandit, 55, produced \u201cevery good idea that we had\u201d to prevent Citigroup\u2019s collapse during the financial crisis, Parsons said. New CEO Michael Corbat , 52, who previously ran the Citi Holdings unit, is well-equipped to lead the firm as it cuts costs and sells unwanted assets, the ex-chairman said.\n\u201cMike Corbat, who I knew back in the day when he ran the Holdings operation, is just that kind of man,\u201d said Parsons, 64, adding that he was \u201csomewhat\u201d surprised by the timing of Pandit\u2019s exit. \u201cThe transition and change was, in the long term, not inevitable but appropriate.\u201d\nParsons oversaw Pandit\u2019s performance since 2007 until stepping down from the board six months ago and was a member of the compensation committee that awarded the CEO\u2019s retention package in May 2011. The deal was designed to keep Pandit at the New York-based bank through cash and stock awards that would pay out over multiple years.\n\u2018Future Performance\u2019\n\u201cThe long-term, multiyear, performance-based structure of this award is designed to retain Vikram as our CEO and reward him for future performance benefiting the company and our shareholders,\u201d Parsons said in a filing announcing the deal. \u201cUnder his leadership, the management team has navigated Citi through the crisis, returned Citi to profitability and is executing a strategy for sustainable growth.\u201d\nShareholders rejected Pandit\u2019s compensation plan in a non- binding vote at the annual meeting in April (APR) , when fellow compensation committee member Michael O\u2019Neill succeeded Parsons as board chairman.\nO\u2019Neill, 65, led the directors who pushed out Pandit after concluding his mismanagement of operations damaged the bank\u2019s credibility, a person familiar with the matter said last week.\nO\u2019Neill and Shannon Bell, a Citigroup spokeswoman, declined to comment on Parsons\u2019s remarks. Pandit didn\u2019t respond to phone and e-mail messages yesterday.\n\u2018Never Blinked\u2019\nSaudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal , who personally owned 218 million Citibank shares as of November 2008, praised Pandit\u2019s handling of the financial crisis while CEO, saying he helped position the bank for further growth.\n\u201cWith the economic crisis many companies like HSBC (HSBA) , Barclays (BARC) and Standard Chartered (STAN) shrank and went back to their roots,\u201d Alwaleed said today at a conference in Dubai. \u201cCitigroup never blinked. It\u2019s the only global bank at the moment and really the potential is there,\u201d he said, adding Pandit did a \u201cgood\u201d job as CEO.\nPandit received about $56 million from Citigroup in annual compensation packages separate from the retention agreement, including some stock awards that have declined in value. The lender paid Pandit $165 million when it bought his Old Lane Partners LP hedge fund in 2007 in a deal that led to his becoming CEO.\nWhile \u201ccompensation is a challenge across the corporate spectrum,\u201d the market remains the best way of determining pay on Wall Street, said Parsons, who also helped to award Pandit\u2019s 2011 pay plan of about $15 million.\n\u2018Simplify Instructions\u2019\nThe former CEO could forfeit almost $33 million in cash and stock tied to the retention deal because of his exit, according to the terms of the arrangement and data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u201cThe system has sort of spun off its axis but how to fix it I don\u2019t know, because I don\u2019t know what the substitute is for the market,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cDo we go out and find the ultimate wise person and say, \u2018You run the system?\u2019 Do we turn it over to politicians, do we turn it over to the unions, do we formulate a bunch of hard-and-fast set of rules?\u201d\nCorbat and O\u2019Neill will have to \u201csimplify instructions\u201d and decide what kinds of banking Citigroup should do around the world, Parsons said. The firm, under Pandit and Parsons, pushed into emerging markets in Latin America and Asia as economic growth slowed in the U.S. and Europe . The company operates in more than 100 countries.\nIl Palazzone\n\u201cThe old notion that we do this very well and therefore we\u2019re going to do it all over the world, well, it may not be appropriate for every place in the world,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cIt may only be appropriate for certain markets where there\u2019s a current need and you can make good money.\u201d\nParsons, visiting his Il Palazzone vineyard to inaugurate a cellar, said regulatory pressures will still be a challenge for the new management team.\n\u201cExternally, it\u2019s still going to be tough,\u201d said Parsons, sipping a glass of his 2004 Brunello Riserva as he sat outside a stone house set on an ancient trail from Frankfurt to Rome . \u201cTo some extent, the regulatory/political community is still almost at war with the big banks.\u201d\nNelson Rockefeller introduced Parsons to fine wines. He plans to turn the hobby into a profitable business by doubling production of red wines that retail in the U.S. for as much as $130 a bottle.\nChanging Landscape\nThe former Citigroup chairman became a director of Bermuda- based investment bank Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) in June and is a board member of Estee Lauder Cos. (EL) , where he is chairman of the compensation committee. He\u2019s also a senior adviser to Providence Equity Partners Inc., which specializes in buying media and telecommunications businesses.\nParsons joined Citigroup\u2019s board in 1996, working with Pandit\u2019s predecessors Sanford I. \u201cSandy\u201d Weill and Charles O. \u201cChuck\u201d Prince as the lender became the world\u2019s biggest bank. A dozen years later, U.S. taxpayers provided a $45 billion bailout that was later repaid.\n\u201cThe regulatory landscape is changing all the time,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to run a big organization with no certainty of what tomorrow brings.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Elisa Martinuzzi in Milan at emartinuzzi@bloomberg.net ; Donal Griffin in New York at dgriffin10@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edward Evans at eevans3@bloomberg.net ; David Scheer at dscheer@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:26:15", "post_time": "2012-10-22 09:56:26", "author": "Elisa Martinuzzi , Donal Griffin", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-22/parsons-sipping-red-wine-calls-pandit-exit-appropriate-.html", "title": "Parsons Sipping Red Wine Calls Pandit Exit \u2018Appropriate\u2019", "post_date": "2012-10-22", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "CRSMBCT", "embers_id": "391ae1dbff3c08a0fe13c9a7608fd63452d13b68"}, {"content": "EU\u2019s Barnier to Propose European Bank Resolution Body Next Year\nBy Boris Groendahl - 2012-10-22T10:37:13Z\nMichel Barnier will present a plan next year to create an authority to shore up or wind down failing banks as a second stage of the European Union\u2019s bank- rule overhaul.\nEstablishing a European body for ailing banks will follow completion of the EU\u2019s first priority, which is creating a single bank supervisor, Barnier, the bloc\u2019s financial regulation chief, said at a press conference in Vienna. The common supervisor will be set up this year and implemented through 2014, as decided by European leaders last week, he said at the briefing in the Austrian capital.\n\u201cThe second stage is that I will, in the course of 2013, present the European Commission a proposal for a European bank resolution authority,\u201d Barnier said. \u201cIf we have a single supervisor, there\u2019s a need for a single resolution authority, which has a certain amount of legal power.\u201d\nHe said the plan was \u201cthat banks pay for banks, not the taxpayer.\u201d\nBarnier, as well as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, have called for the supervisor to be the first step in building a so-called banking union. EU leaders in June embarked on plans to build a common supervisor as a step toward offering direct bank bailouts from the firewall fund for the countries that share the euro.\nBarnier offered, as part of a draft law on failing lenders that he proposed in June, a plan to provide for national backstops that could to borrow from each other as a last resort, and require them to join forces to stabilize a struggling cross- border bank.\nHe described the measure as an interim step, yet even this incremental move has proved highly controversial. While Italy and France supported the proposals, Germany and Sweden , two EU nations that already have pre-financed funds to stablize failing banks, have both called for the plan to be scrapped.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Boris Groendahl in Vienna at bgroendahl@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Frank Connelly at fconnelly@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:26:15", "post_time": "2012-10-22 06:37:13", "author": "Boris Groendahl", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-22/eu-s-barnier-to-propose-european-bank-resolution-body-next-year.html", "title": "EU\u2019s Barnier to Propose European Bank Resolution Body Next Year", "post_date": "2012-10-22", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "CRSMBCT", "embers_id": "9a311539d0785b36679924089779d8192605b257"}, {"content": "European Stocks Fall as EU Leaders Fail to Discuss Spain\nBy Tom Stoukas - 2012-10-19T15:58:53Z\nEuropean (SXXP) stocks fell, snapping four days of gains, after yesterday rising to their highest valuation since 2010, and as European Union leaders failed to discuss further aid for Spain.\nBankia SA led lenders lower, losing 14 percent as a gauge of banks contributed most to the Stoxx Europe 600 Index\u2019s drop. Aggreko Plc (AGK) fell 7.2 percent after it said bad-debt provisions would hurt full-year results. Spectris Plc (SXS) surged 12 percent after it reported a 12 percent increase in sales last quarter and said it will meet its full-year targets. Carrefour SA (CA) advanced 5.9 percent after it agreed to sell its Colombian unit.\nThe Stoxx 600 fell 0.8 percent to 274.08 at the close of trading, paring its weekly gain to 1.7 percent. The gauge has rallied 17 percent from this year\u2019s low on June 4 as the European Central Bank agreed on a bond-purchase program and the Federal Reserve announced further stimulus. Shares yesterday rose to 12.33 times their estimated profit, the highest price- earnings ratios since 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\u201cWe\u2019re towards the top of the recent range, so from a short term technical standpoint you can understand why if there\u2019s a bit of bad news out there then people may either just stop buying or take a bit of profit,\u201d said Stewart Richardson, chief investment officer of RMG Wealth Management in London .\nFrench President Francois Hollande said additional assistance for Spain wasn\u2019t discussed at the summit of European leaders in Brussels.\nBank Supervisor\nLeaders committed to their goal of establishing a euro-area bank supervisor by the end of the year. The EU will seek to agree on a framework that makes the ECB the main supervisor by Jan. 1, according to conclusions released early today after leaders met. The new system, intended to break the link between banks and governments at the root of the region\u2019s financial crisis, will phase in over the next year and could cover all 6,000 euro-area banks by Jan. 1, 2014, a year later than initially targeted.\nStill, the move doesn\u2019t settle the question of when the European Stability Mechanism will be able to recapitalize banks directly. The plan calls for the supervisor to take charge of big banks and bailed-out institutions first, while also saying direct assistance requires \u201ceffective\u201d supervision in place.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said after the summit that it\u2019s an open question whether European policy makers can meet the deadline they\u2019d set hours earlier to establish a euro-area bank supervisor.\nComplicated Questions\n\u201cThere are complicated questions to clarify and we\u2019ll see in December if we complete it or not,\u201d Merkel told reporters after the two-day European Union meeting wrapped up today.\nShe also ruled out allowing Spain to shift bank-bailout loans off its balance sheet if they are made before the new system starts operating.\n\u201cThe direct injection of capital into banks can now only happen once the supervisory framework has been put in place, which means now about sometime in 2013, which is different to the expectation of immediate recapitalization once the ESM was set up,\u201d said William De Vijlder, CIO Strategy & Partners, BNP Paribas Investment Partners. \u201cThis triggers the questions: will this have an impact on the speed at which the Spanish banking recapitalization will be taken on, and how will rating agencies react to that?

The refiner, rated BBB- by Fitch and one step lower at Ba1 by Moody\u2019s Investors Services, its highest junk level, is raising funds after the average yield on debt for emerging-market oil and gas companies tumbled to 3.9 percent from 5.5 percent a year ago, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. index showed.\nTurkey was among seven countries exempted in June from U.S. oil sanctions on Iran for a renewable six-month period because they reduced trade with the Islamic republic, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said at the time. Tupras pledged on March 30 to cut its purchases of 180,000 barrels a day of Iranian crude by 20 percent following a U.S. law giving nations until June 28 to show reductions.\n\u201cTupras was buying Iranian crude on lira-based long-time contracts, and now with 20 percent of Iranian supplies gone, they will have to make it up with shorter-term dollar-based contracts,\u201d Hasan Sener, an analyst at Istanbul-based Oyak Securities, said by phone yesterday. The bond will finance additional working capital needs, he said.\nIran Sanctions\nTurkey, which imports 95 percent of its oil needs, is buying more crude from Russia and Saudi Arabia as it seeks to extend the U.S. exemption on purchases from Iran, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said Oct. 15. Iran was Turkey\u2019s top supplier in the first half of this year, according to the energy market regulator\u2019s website.\nYildiz said Turkey is in talks with U.S. officials on the waiver, which expires Dec. 6, and expects the dispensation to be granted. If a country fails to meet the terms of the law, its banks settling trades with Iran risk being shut out of the U.S. financial system. The U.S. sanctions are designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful medical purposes and power generation.\n\u201cA ban on purchases of Iranian oil due to international sanctions could be negative for Tupras\u2019s refining margins and working-capital needs, if Iranian crude cannot be economically replaced with suitable alternative sources,\u201d Arkadiusz Wicik, a director at Fitch Ratings, said in a statement Oct. 17. Fitch said in its statement that a substantial reduction in Iranian imports by Tupras \u201cwould be treated as an event risk\u201d which could lead to a review of its rating.\n\u2018Dominant Position\u2019\nMoody\u2019s assigned its Ba1 rating to Kocaeli, Turkey-based Tupras on Oct. 18, the same as its grade for Turkey. The refiner is owned by Koc Holding AS (KCHOL) , Turkey\u2019s biggest conglomerate.\n\u201cThe ratings primarily reflect Tupras\u2019s dominant position in the Turkish market, as well as the execution risks associated with the company\u2019s ongoing capital expenditure investment program,\u201d Martin Kohlhase, Moody\u2019s lead analyst for Tupras, said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. \u201cTupras ratings also incorporate challenges, including future profitability compression from reduced sourcing of discounted Iranian crude.\u201d\nTupras hired Citigroup Inc. (C) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) to arrange the sale, which would be Turkey\u2019s largest by a non-financial institution, the company said Oct. 17. Investor meetings start from today in Europe and the U.S.\nCorporate Bonds\nTurkish non-financial companies are planning debt sales to take advantage of declining international rates.\nIstanbul-based Anadolu Efes Biracilik & Malt Sanayii AS, Turkey\u2019s largest brewery that received an investment-grade Baa3 rating from Moody\u2019s Oct. 10, is the second company, after Tupras, to announce an investment-grade bond sale in the past month as bets increased the nation\u2019s sovereign rating is heading for an upgrade.\nTurkey is \u201cquite close\u201d to being reviewed and its growth is consistent with a lower inflation rate and current-account deficit, Paul Rawkins , senior director at Fitch, told a London conference last week. Fitch rates Turkey BB+, one level below investment grade, while Standard & Poor\u2019s places it one step lower at BB.\nEfes, which hired JPMorgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) for the offering, sold $500 million of October 2022 bonds at a yield of 175 basis points above 10-year U.S. Treasuries, a banker involved in the deal said today, declining to be identified as the transaction isn\u2019t yet public.\nTwo-Year Yield\nCalik Holding AS, with interests in media, energy and construction, won a B rating from S&P Oct. 17 for a planned bond sale worth $300 million maturing in 2017.\nThe lira fell 0.1 percent to 1.7954 per dollar at 5:28 p.m. in Istanbul yesterday, paring its gain this year to 5.2 percent.\nThe yield on Turkey\u2019s two-year local currency notes fell eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 7.28 percent, 76 basis points less than two-year Brazilian debt. On Sept. 14 the yield on Turkish debt was 87 basis points lower.\nThe extra yield investors demand to hold Turkey\u2019s dollar- denominated sovereign bonds rather than U.S. Treasuries rose four basis points to 207 today, JPMorgan (JPM) \u2019s EMBI Global index showed. That compares with 385 at the end of 2011, and with 134 basis points for Brazil today.\nCredit-default swaps on Turkey climbed three basis points to 153, in comparison with 133 for Russia and 90 for Poland . Rising prices show deteriorating perceptions of a borrower\u2019s creditworthiness. The contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or cash equivalent should a government or company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.\nFour Refineries\n\u201cAfter big corporates such as Tupras set a benchmark for Turkish corporate bond sales, other smaller companies will follow suit,\u201d Cem Karakas, chief financial officer of Istanbul- based Yildiz Holding AS, maker of Godiva chocolates, said in an interview in Istanbul Oct. 17.\nTupras, operating Turkey\u2019s four refineries, aims to complete a $2.4 billion project by 2015 to turn high-sulfur products such as fuel-oil into low-sulfur ones including diesel.\nThe main purpose of the debt sale is diversification of financial sources, and to help manage liquidity and interest- rate risk, Tupras said in an e-mailed statement Oct. 17.\n\u201cInterest rates are so low at the moment that they are opening a window of opportunity for Turkish corporates,\u201d Alper Paksoy, head of research at TEB Investment, an Istanbul-based unit of BNP Paribas SA, said in a phone interview yesterday. \u201cTupras is one of the most sound.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ercan Ersoy in Istanbul at eersoy@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Benedikt Kammel at bkammel@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:26:20", "post_time": "2012-10-19 10:35:55", "author": "Ercan Ersoy", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-19/iran-risk-lurks-in-shadows-as-refiner-sells-bonds-turkey-credit.html", "title": "Iran Risk Lurks in Shadows as Refiner Sells Bonds: Turkey Credit", "post_date": "2012-10-19", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "CRSMBCT", "embers_id": "b9fde08d948712bc0483a5eaa123195784d8a6e7"}, {"content": "Swiss Stocks Decline as Spain Says Bailout Not Imminent\nBy Tom Stoukas - 2012-10-03T10:30:01Z\nStocks in Switzerland declined as Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said a bailout for the country isn\u2019t imminent and a report showed China\u2019s services industry expanded at the slowest rate in 19 months.\nJulius Baer Group Ltd.

(HOLN) to pay penalties for failing to meet clean-energy obligations at power plants they operate.\nTwo judges of Rajasthan High Court \u2019s Jaipur bench dismissed an appeal by Hindustan Zinc Ltd. (HZ) , Ambuja Cements Ltd., Grasim Industries Ltd. (GRASIM) and 14 other companies that challenged a government order to purchase a minimum amount of renewable energy at their plants, according to the Aug. 31 judgment on the court website.\nHolcim\u2019s Ambuja said in an e-mail that it\u2019s studying the order\u2019s implications. Vedanta\u2019s Hindustan Zinc and Grasim didn\u2019t respond to e-mails and phone calls seeking comment. Vedanta fell as much as 3.6 percent in London and Holcim lost as much as 1.1 percent in Zurich, its biggest decline since Sept. 4.\nIndia requires electricity distributors and large industrial consumers of power, such as cement factories, miners and steelmakers, to buy as much as 10 percent of their energy from wind farms, biomass plants and other renewable utilities. State regulators are responsible for enforcing the targets.\n\u201cThis is important because it will act as a precedent for similar court cases in other states\u201d like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu , said Vibhav Nuwal, director of REConnect Energy Solutions Pvt., which advises companies in the industry. Such enforcement is key to ensuring the success of India\u2019s one-year-old renewable energy trading market, which allows companies to buy and sell certificates to meet their clean-power obligations.\nPotential Penalties\nHindustan Zinc and Ambuja may be liable to pay as much as 913 million rupees ($16.5 million) based on an estimate by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, whose calculations assume the companies face the same renewable purchase obligations in all states where they operate.\nHindustan Zinc\u2019s liability could be about 839 million rupees and Ambuja\u2019s 75 million rupees based on power generation and consumption figures from their latest annual reports and penalty amounts of 3,300 rupees and 13,400 rupees a megawatt- hour set by regulators for non-solar and solar certificates respectively.\nHindustan Zinc fell 1.1 percent to 130.95 rupees at the close in Mumbai. Ambuja lost 0.2 percent to 191.35 rupees and Grasim rose 0.8 percent to 3,035.95 rupees. The benchmark Sensitive Index gained 0.1 percent.\nChronic Blackouts\nIndia suffers from an average 9 percent power deficit and an overburdened grid that lead to chronic blackouts and surging electricity prices at peak hours of demand. Companies like Hindustan Zinc and Ambuja build coal and diesel-fired generation units, known as captive power plants , which provide reliable electricity to their sites and extra revenue from selling excess power to the grid.\nAccording to the judgment, the companies argued that the Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission was acting beyond its powers and that its order for them to buy clean power or face fines was a violation of India\u2019s 2003 Electricity Act and of the constitution. The companies said that as independent power plants without distribution licenses, they should be exempt from the targets.\n\u201cThe submission is baseless,\u201d judges Arun Mishra and Narendra Kumar Jain said in their ruling. The companies misconstrued legal provisions to argue their case, they said.\nThe renewable targets are lawful and the state regulator has the authority to enforce them, the judges said.\n\u201cThe writ petitions being devoid of merits are hereby dismissed,\u201d they said, ordering the companies to pay their fines immediately.\nThe case is Ambuja Cements Ltd.

The cement maker also cut its outlook for the region as it reported second-quarter earnings, predicting a contraction for 2012 after previously anticipating a stable development.\n\u201cWhen the market goes so low you need to adapt your cost,\u201d Fontana, who took over in February, said on a conference call. Spain , Italy and Bulgaria suffered the steepest volume declines, he said.\nHolcim dropped the most in 3 weeks, as its European outlook mirrored that of Dublin-based building-materials maker CRH Plc (CRH) , which said yesterday that it is advancing a cost-cutting program as European sales drop faster than anticipated. Holcim cut almost a third of employees in Spain in July, as it battles overcapacity in southern Europe.\n\u201cTrade unions understand that the economic situation in some parts of Europe is really difficult,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Thomas Aebischer said in an interview, adding that dialog with worker representatives \u201cwill continue\u201d.

The drop was the biggest since July 23, valuing Holcim at about 19.51 billion Swiss francs.\nManagement Shake-Up\nA building slump in Europe , which accounted for 29 percent of Holcim\u2019s sales in 2011, means cement makers are in the midst of restructuring their units in that region, including headcount reductions and plant closures.\nSecond-quarter net income at Holcim rose 9.2 percent from a year earlier to 379 million Swiss francs ($389 million). The gain was Holcim\u2019s first in five consecutive quarters. Sales rose 2 percent to 5.6 billion francs, below the 5.7 billion-franc average estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.\nAs part of the changes announced today, three managers will leave the executive committee and Urs Bleisch has been promoted to head Fontana\u2019s \u201cHolcim Leadership Journey\u201d.\nHolcim will bundle several European divisions into one unit led by Roland Koehler, who is now CEO of Holcim Group Support Ltd.

The stock declined 1.4 percent to 388.7 francs at 12:10 p.m. in Zurich.\n\u201cThere is continuing price erosion in the Swiss mobile market, but we were almost capable to fully compensate this by the acquisition of new customers,\u201d Swisscom Chief Executive officer Carsten Schloter said.\nSwisscom bought Italian fixed-line operator Fastweb SpA in 2007 to compensate for slowing domestic growth. The Bern-based operator has suffered from competition in Italy and is the latest example of a Swiss company hampered by a declining euro that crimps sales converted into francs. Companies exporting to the 17-nation currency area, such as Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , Roche Holding AG (ROG) and Lonza Group AG (LONN) have seen revenue hit during Europe\u2019s debt crisis, which has prompted the Swiss National Bank to defend an exchange rate ceiling.\nFranc Ceiling\nSwitzerland\u2019s central bank has pledged to enforce the franc ceiling of 1.20 per euro since September to fight deflation and help exporters. The franc has traded in a range of 1.20 to 1.24 since the cap was imposed, breaching it just once on April 5.\nSecond-quarter net income declined to 468 million francs from 485 million francs a year earlier, Swisscom said in a statement . Revenue fell 1.4 percent to 2.82 billion francs. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated net income of 464 million francs and sales of 2.83 billion francs.\nSwisscom in June started flat-rate mobile and Internet plans and has launched offerings to counter competition and declining revenue from traditional calls. \u201cDemand remains strong for bundled offerings such as Vivo Casa, which combines fixed-line access with telephony, Internet and TV, or Vivo Tutto, which also includes a mobile line,\u201d the company said.\nDividend Forecast\nSwisscom repeated a prediction of 2012 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 4.4 billion francs. The operator said that if all 2012 targets are met, it plans to propose a dividend of 22 francs per share to be paid next year. Second-quarter Ebitda fell 1 percent to 1.13 billion francs, or 40.2 percent of sales, compared with 40 percent a year earlier.\n\u201cIn principle I am very positive. Swisscom managed to increase the margin even though sales decreased,\u201d said Michael Inauen, an analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank in Zurich. \u201cConsidering that Swisscom rather disappointed in the past, the good results in the first half 2012 may have led shareholders,\u201d to sell shares to realize profits.\nThe shares have gained 9.2 percent this year compared with a 0.9 percent drop of the 23-member Bloomberg Europe Telecommunications Services Index.\nSwisscom\u2019s domestic operations reported a 0.7 percent decline in revenue. Customer growth and new bundled offerings have been compensating for falling sales resulting from competition, pressure on prices and changes in the customer behavior. Users are increasingly switching from services such as phone calls and text messages to new IP-based applications and social media platforms, Swisscom has said.\n\u201cWe expect 80,000 new customers in the bundled products segment with TV in the second semester,\u201d Schloter said. \u201cOn the whole, we think that customer growth in Switzerland will considerably surpass the 80,000 in the next six months.\u201d\nThe customer base at Fastweb grew by 78,000 users to 1.67 million in the first half of the year. Second-quarter net revenue at the business fell 2.3 percent to 430 million euros ($533 million).\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Joseph de Weck in Frankfurt at jdeweck@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:26:57", "post_time": "2012-08-08 06:19:19", "author": "Joseph de Weck", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-08/swisscom-second-quarter-profit-drops-less-than-analyst-estimate.html", "title": "Swisscom Lowers Full-Year Sales Forecast on Stronger Franc", "post_date": "2012-08-08", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "CRSMBCT", "embers_id": "066a4a7dd78373e9a79fc3af120e8fb2f93b1748"}, {"content": "Lafarge S.

Then, in the spring of 2010, he was arrested and his firm was shut down as part of a purge of brokers by President Hugo Chavez.\nToday, according to his sister, Nathalie, Sifontes is studying Chinese history in the basement of a military prison and teaching guards English from his cell, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its January issue.\nChavez, ruler of the oil-rich country since 1999, has publicly blamed bond traders for accelerating inflation and devaluing the bolivar, Venezuela\u2019s currency. In 2010, the country\u2019s inflation rate was 27.2 percent. In just one month, from March to April of that year, consumer prices rose 5.2 percent.\nOn May 25, 2010, Sifontes and three of his partners at Econoinvest Casa de Bolsa CA were taken into custody by federal police. Within days, seven other brokers were arrested. Three weeks later, the financiers were formally accused by government prosecutors of illegal currency trading .\nTomas Sanchez , president of Venezuela\u2019s National Securities Commission, said in a June 2010 interview with Bloomberg News that the brokers, who traded currencies on the bond market, were setting arbitrary exchange rates and crippling the economy.\n\u201cThese were financial thugs,\u201d he said.\n\u2018Nest of Mafiosos\u2019\nOn Venezuelan television in July 2010, Chavez described Sifontes and his associates as \u201ca nest of mafiosos.\u201d He also accused them of purchasing securities under false identities, though no such charges were ever formally lodged against them.\nSince the government crackdown, more than 50 brokerages have gone out of business. Meanwhile, the economy has failed to pick up. Gross domestic product growth is expected to be 2.8 percent in 2011, according to the International Monetary Fund . That compares with an average 4.5 percent for Latin America and the Caribbean.\nAs of November, the annualized inflation rate stood at 27.6 percent, the highest among 78 countries tracked by Bloomberg. In an attempt to slow inflation, Chavez froze the prices of 18 personal care items from deodorant to toilet paper on Nov. 22 as part of a law that will seek to regulate as many as 500,000 prices in the economy.\nWhile the economy grew 4.2 percent in the third quarter, key areas such as food production contracted 9 percent, adding to inflationary pressures. Amid a slow economic recovery, uncertainty shrouds Venezuelan politics.\nSix More Years\nChavez announced in June that he had been diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer. A 57-year-old ex-soldier who has overcome a number of barriers -- including a poverty-stricken upbringing and two years in prison after a failed coup d\u2019etat against the government in 1992 -- Chavez has said his illness will not deter him from seeking a third six-year term in the October 2012 elections.\nAs the election approaches, the government still has financial resources that can help Chavez at the polls. Venezuela, South America \u2019s biggest oil producer, can borrow money, albeit at high interest rates . During 2011, the government sold a record $7.2 billion of bonds to give the economy a boost, including stimulus spending on agriculture, public housing and job creation .\nSifontes and the other brokers were arrested at a time when the economy was hit by high inflation and an increasingly weak bolivar. In January 2010, Chavez announced a 50 percent devaluation of the currency, the first such measure in five years. The government then set two official exchange rates. One for essential imports such as food, medicine and machinery, which stood at 2.6 bolivars to the dollar, and a second rate for all other transactions, which stood at 4.3 bolivars to the dollar.\nPlunging Bolivar\nThere was, however, another legal means of trading currencies: the bond market of which Sifontes and Econoinvest were a part. During the first five months of 2010, the fluctuating exchange rate on the bond market plunged 26 percent, reaching a record low of 8.2 bolivars to the dollar on May 11.\nVenezuelans who purchased bonds to obtain dollars deposited their money in foreign bank accounts. These funds could be held as savings or used to pay in dollars for imports. Bond trading was not only legal at the time; the government participated in it by issuing bonds of its own.\nIn late 2009 and early 2010, Central Bank President Nelson Merentes made it clear that the government believed the country\u2019s brokerages were instrumental in Venezuela\u2019s economic decline, according to Eduardo Fortuny, then a board member of the Venezuelan Association of Brokerage Houses .\nPrivate Meetings\nIn private meetings with the group, Merentes called on the brokers to halt the bolivar\u2019s slide or risk a possible confiscation of their businesses, Fortuny says. Merentes declined to comment on Fortuny\u2019s account.\nOne week before Sifontes was arrested along with his Econoinvest partners Miguel Osio Zamora, Juan Carlos Carvallo  and Ernesto Rangel, the government suspended private trading in dollar-denominated bonds and imposed new controls that gave only state agencies, not private brokers, the right to trade in them.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no economic reasoning for the weakening of the bolivar,\u201d Chavez said on state television. \u201cThis is a huge fraud against the republic.\u201d\nAs of early December 2011, Sifontes and his colleagues had yet to go to trial. Under Venezuelan law, they can be held for up to two years before getting their day in court. The only time Sifontes has formally addressed his guilt or innocence since his arrest was during a preliminary hearing on Jan. 16, 2011.\nCourt Testimony\nWhile the hearing was closed to the public and the media, an official court video recording of the proceedings obtained by Bloomberg News shows Sifontes saying bond trading was a legitimate business.\nIndeed, one of his clients was the state-owned oil company , Petroleos de Venezuela SA , he says; another was the state telecommunications company, Cia.

We didn\u2019t act behind the government\u2019s back.\u201d\nOn the recording, Sifontes can be seen showing a PowerPoint presentation to the judge.\n\u201cWe had government support for our operations after they established and promoted an open, alternative market as a public policy,\u201d Sifontes says.\n\u2018Arbitrary Measure\u2019\nTo find Sifontes and the other brokers guilty would be a travesty of justice, says Luis Valdivieso, Sifontes\u2019s lawyer.\nWhile the new controls on trading became effective on May 18, 2010, the government is seeking to prosecute the brokers for trades they had been making since the mid-2000s, when Chavez liberalized foreign-exchange transactions as part of what he once called the \u201cdemocratization of capital markets .\u201d \u201cEvery person who bought and sold securities to obtain dollars in Venezuela since 2004 would also be guilty of the same crime,\u201d Valdivieso says.\nA Ministry of Planning and Finance official declined to comment on the case. Questions e-mailed to Finance Minister Jorge Giordani weren\u2019t answered.\nOn Nov. 14, Chavez defended his decision to shutter the capital markets and denied that it was an arbitrary decision.\nThe opposition \u201csays that Econoinvest was the flagship company, the best of the best,\u201d Chavez said. \u201cThey insist that I took an arbitrary measure against them, but they defend corruption.\u201d\nGrandstanding Gesture\nThe brokerage crackdown was a typically grandstanding gesture by the Chavez government, says Boris Segura , a Latin America strategist at Nomura Securities International Inc. in New York .\n\u201cThey wanted to send a signal to the rest of the market: If you don\u2019t behave, you\u2019re going to go to jail,\u201d Segura says.\nSifontes was a likely target, given his prominence in the Venezuelan business community as executive director of Econoinvest, which had 937.2 million bolivars ($218.2 million) in assets before the government placed it in receivership following the crackdown.\nMarried, with three children, Sifontes, 48, had worked in finance for 20 years.\nSifontes learned that the government was closing in on him when he was having lunch in the upscale Caracas neighborhood of Las Mercedes. He received a call from the Econoinvest office on his mobile phone, according to Gabriel Osio, Miguel\u2019s brother.\nGovernment Raid\nSifontes was informed that a group of government officials, including two public prosecutors, 14 detectives and eight inspectors, were carrying out a raid on the office, seizing computers and documents and interviewing some of the firm\u2019s 600 employees, Gabriel Osio says.\nGabriel Osio, 44, was president of Econoinvest\u2019s executive committee. He was also president of the Venezuelan Association of Brokerage Houses and vice president of the Caracas Stock Exchange . That day, he was eating at a restaurant in the Los Palos Grandes neighborhood, closer to the office, with his brother Miguel, 42, Econoinvest\u2019s legal director; Rangel, 42, managing director; and Carvallo, 42, sales and marketing director.\nGabriel, who was recovering from dengue fever, says he left the lunch early. He says his brother, Carvallo and Rangel returned to the office, where they joined Sifontes and were taken into custody at about 8 p.m.\nGabriel says he subsequently fled Venezuela to Florida and is seeking political asylum in the U.S. Miguel urged him not to return to Venezuela, Gabriel says: \u201cMy brother told me to stay out of it.\u201d\nFleeing Brokers\nOsio says dozens of brokerage executives fled the country in the coming weeks, some because they were named in arrest warrants and others who feared they could be next.\nFrom his Miami base, he says he\u2019s managing the finances of Econoinvest\u2019s holding company, Econoinvest Capital SA (ECO/A) , which continues to operate some businesses, including a Panama-based brokerage.\nChavez\u2019s naming of more radical officials like securities regulator Sanchez and finance minister Giordani before the crackdown was a signal of things to come, Osio said.\n\u201cEverything changed with the new finance minister,\u201d he said.\nThe buzz of the bond market is a far cry from Sifontes\u2019s new home, a prison in the working-class Caracas neighborhood of Boleita operated by the Directorate of Military Intelligence. As the months tick by, Sifontes and his fellow inmates, Miguel Osio Zamora, Carvallo and Rangel have tried to keep busy,  Nathalie Sifontes says.\nHer brother has been taking online courses from Madrid- based Universidad de Alcala .\nPrison Life\n\u201cI think that thanks to his studies, he hasn\u2019t felt the full weight of being behind bars,\u201d she says.\nCarvallo has learned Italian, Nathalie Sifontes says. Rangel lifts weights and manages his Guataca Producciones recording label, which promotes contemporary Venezuelan music. The men visit a sunny terrace once a week for exercise before returning to the harsh fluorescent lights of their separate prison cells, she says.\nTwo months before his arrest, Herman Sifontes reviewed Niall Ferguson \u2019s 2008 book, \u201cThe Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World,\u201d for Venezuela\u2019s Institute of Finance and Business. Ending his review on the institute\u2019s website, Sifontes pointed to what he thought was the book\u2019s great lesson: \u201cDemocracy, in its broadest sense, must incorporate the business world.\u201d\n\u2018Venezuela\u2019s Problem\u2019\nUnder Chavez, the Venezuelan government operates by different rules, Sifontes said in his videotaped court testimony.\n\u201cThe government has created conditions so that the people don\u2019t believe in the bolivar and prefer to have dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is Venezuela\u2019s political, economic and sociological problem.\u201d\nEven a politician as powerful as Hugo Chavez can\u2019t, it seems, make the markets bend to his will, no matter how often he changes the rules and how many brokers he throws in jail.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Daniel Cancel in Caracas at dcancel@bloomberg.net ; Corina Pons in Caracas at crpons@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Joshua Goodman at jgoodman19@bloomberg.net\nHugo Chavez\nChris\nHugo Chavez, Venezuela's president, speaks at a meeting during the COP15 United Nations Climate Change Conference at the Bella Centre in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Wednesday, Dec. 16, 2009.

Gold volumes reflected changes to the mine plan at the company\u2019s Grasberg operation in Indonesia and a slower-than-expected ramp-up at the site\u2019s Deep Ore Zone underground project.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of a shortfall there on the gold side but nothing really shocking there coming out of the quarter,\u201d Kuni Chen, an analyst at CRT Capital Group LLC in Stamford , Connecticut , said by telephone.\nFreeport\u2019s Indonesian operations had sales of 195 million pounds of copper and 384,000 ounces of gold in the third quarter, compared with 253 million pounds and 384,000 ounces a year ago.\nThe Grasberg mine was halted for more than two weeks in the first quarter and required \u201cextensive repairs\u201d after violence flared among employees in the aftermath of a three-month strike last year, Freeport said. Grasberg, which has the world\u2019s largest recoverable copper reserves, accounted for 19 percent of Freeport\u2019s revenue last year.\nCopper Prices\nCopper for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange averaged $7,720.85 a metric ton in the quarter, 14 percent less than a year earlier on concern that an economic slowdown in China , the biggest consumer of the metal, would weaken demand.\nFreeport cut its forecast for 2012 gold sales to 1 million ounces. Copper sales are still expected to be 3.6 billion pounds this year and may rise 19 percent, to 4.3 billion pounds, in 2013, the company said. It also forecast sales of 1.4 million ounces of gold and 90 million pounds of molybdenum next year.\nFreeport, which operates mines in Indonesia, Africa and the Americas, plans to increase annual copper output by more than 25 percent in the next three years, Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson said July 19.\nThe shares fell 1.3 percent to $40.66 at 10:35 a.m. in New York .\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Liezel Hill in Toronto at lhill30@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Steven Frank at sfrank9@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:28:59", "post_time": "2012-10-22 10:39:48", "author": "Liezel Hill", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-22/freeport-s-adjusted-earnings-miss-estimates-as-costs-rise-1-.html", "title": "Freeport\u2019s Adjusted Earnings Miss Estimates as Costs Rise", "post_date": "2012-10-22", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IGBVL", "embers_id": "74b1ea1706d5c1de8f8b9fbfa4f3087e76db995b"}, {"content": "Wheat Climbs; Gold Prices Seen Gaining: Commodities at Close\nBy Christian Schmollinger - 2012-10-22T09:45:04Z\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities gained 0.3 percent to 658.04 at 5:42 p.m. Singapore time.

Kavanagh - 2012-09-28T08:51:22Z\nDemocratic Republic of Congo\u2019s economy will grow an estimated 8.2 percent to 18.9 trillion Congolese francs ($20.7 billion) next year, the International Monetary Fund said in a statement on its website.\nThe Central African country\u2019s economy should expand about 7.2 percent this year to 16.4 trillion francs, the IMF said in the statement yesterday after an annual \u201c Article IV \u201d review of Congo\u2019s economic development and policies. The Washington-based international lender has a three-year, $561 million loan agreement with the country.\n\u201cIn the past few years, economic performance in the DRC has shown marked improvement although progress in alleviating poverty\u201d has lagged, according to the statement. \u201cStrong trade and investment inflows from non-European countries, driven mainly by the mining sector, have provided the main impetus to growth.\u201d\nCongo produces about 4 percent of the world\u2019s copper and nearly half its cobalt, and has deposits of gold, diamonds, and tin. The potential mineral riches have attracted a $6 billion minerals-for-infrastructure agreement with China . Hong Kong- based Minmetals Resources Ltd. and Jinchuan Group Ltd. (2362) acquired mining projects in Congo in the past 13 months.\nTransparency Lacking\nPhoenix-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) \u2019s $2 billion Tenke copper and cobalt project is the largest single investment in the country.\nWhile the economy has expanded since the end of nearly a decade of war in 2003, the United Nations Development Programme ranked Congo the least-developed country in the world last year.\nAn increase in external debt arrears and poor governance of its natural-resource industry may hamper the country\u2019s economic progress, the IMF said.\nThe IMF delayed Congo\u2019s last two loan disbursements, worth more than $150 million combined, in part because of a lack of transparency and accountability at the country\u2019s state-owned mining companies, according to the statement. The companies are required to publish contracts and report deal details under the IMF agreement.\n\u201cPoverty remains widespread, the economy is vulnerable to domestic and external risks, and program delays are cause for concern,\u201d according to the fund\u2019s statement. \u201cDirectors called for steadfast efforts to preserve fiscal credibility, strengthen the monetary policy framework, and improve the governance of extractive industries.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Michael J.

(5713) , Japan\u2019s second-largest copper producer, expects higher processing fees next year as raw material supply from new and existing mining projects will probably increase.\nThe fees, known as treatment and refining charges or TC/RCs, for copper concentrate, or semi-processed ore, will increase from this year\u2019s level of $63.50 a metric ton and 6.35 cents a pound agreed between Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) and major Japanese producers, President Nobumasa Kemori said.\nSumitomo Metal Mining joins JX Nippon Mining & Metals Corp. and Aurubis AG (NDA) in seeking higher fees. World mine output may increase 14 percent to 14.45 million tons in 2013, while smelting capacity may rise 11 percent to 16.26 million tons with operating rates of 89 percent, according to data from Pan Pacific Copper Co. Increasing fees boost smelters\u2019 revenue.\n\u201cSpot TC/RCs have been increasing\u201d as the yen\u2019s strength against the dollar reduced margins for Japanese smelters and Chinese buyers were reluctant to purchase concentrate because of the unfavorable difference between prices in Shanghai and London, Kemori said in an interview yesterday. The yen has strengthened 7.9 percent since the year\u2019s high of 83.20 on March 15.\nTC/RCs in the spot market are likely to gain in the next several months and are at about $70 and 7 cents, Aurubis said in a report Sept. 25. Treatment fees are expressed in dollars per ton of concentrate received and refining fees in cents per pound of copper in the ore. The fees are deducted from the price paid by smelters to mining companies for the raw material.\nMining Projects\nCopper in London has climbed 8.8 percent this year and traded at $8,267 a ton at 3:36 p.m. in Tokyo . The metal reached a four-month high Sept. 19 after the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank said they would buy more debt and China, the biggest copper user, approved a $158 billion subways-to- roads construction plan.\nSumitomo Metal Mining has plans to participate in overseas mine development projects to achieve output of 300,000 tons from its own mining interests by 2020 from 120,000 tons currently. The company is reviewing two to three mine projects in South America , Kemori said.\nThe company will add 60,000 tons of copper output from its mining interests by that time and its Sierra Gorda mine in Chile, which is scheduled to start in 2014, will add 70,000 tons, Kemori said May 17. The final 50,000 tons will be secured through other foreign mine investments, with projects in Canada, the U.S, Chile, Peru and Argentina being considered, he said.\nThe Sierra Gorda project plans to initially produce 110,000 tons of copper in concentrate a year before increasing capacity to 190,000 tons by 2017, Kemori said. Sumitomo Metal owns 31.5 percent and Sumitomo Corp. (8053) has a 13.5 percent holding in the project, while KGHM International Ltd. holds a 55 percent stake.\nSumitomo Metal Mining already has stakes in mines including Morenci in the U.S., Candelaria, Cerro Verde and Ojos del Salado in Chile, Northparkes in Australia and Batu Hijau in Indonesia, the company\u2019s website said. The company\u2019s shares rose 0.9 percent today to close at 985 yen in Tokyo.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jae Hur in Tokyo at jhur1@bloomberg.net ; Ichiro Suzuki in Tokyo at isuzuki@bloomberg.net .\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Poole at jpoole4@bloomberg.net\nSumitomo Metal Mining Co.

They ended the session at 92 cents.\nTrack One\nEmission Reduction Units are generated under the UN Joint Implementation program, which encourages investments in low- carbon energy by industrialized countries in other nations that have emission-reduction goals under the Kyoto Protocol, whose first period runs from 2008 to 2012.\nThe EU proposal would bar emitters in the bloc\u2019s cap-and- trade from holding in their accounts ERUs issued after 2012 by non-EU countries such as Russia , the people said. That nation is not planning to adopt a new set of binding climate goals under the Kyoto Protocol after its first phase expires. It generates credits in a procedure overseen by the government known as Track One.\nERUs from countries without new emission-reduction targets in place until 2020, and whose greenhouse-gas cutting projects are approved by UN regulators, would be allowed for use in the EU as long as they were issued before the end of April 2013, and covered emissions reductions achieved before the end of 2012, according to the people. This procedure , where issuance of ERUs under the Joint Implementation program is supervised by UN authorities, is referred to as Track Two.\nInternational Offsets\nAlong with Certified Emission Reduction offsets issued under another UN program, the Clean Development Mechanism, ERUs offer emitters in the EU program a cheaper form of compliance with their pollution limits.\nCER credits for December, which are not subject to any restrictions under the commission\u2019s proposal, fell as much as 26 percent to a record of 1.05 euros a metric ton. The contract closed 23 percent lower at 1.10 euros on London\u2019s ICE Futures Europe exchange, its biggest-ever daily slump.\nJI projects are hosted by some EU nations and countries including Russia and Ukraine. While the EU has declared it would adopt targets under the Kyoto Protocol until 2020, Russia has said it won\u2019t commit to a new set of goals. Nations are set to discuss the global climate framework when they meet at a two- week UN summit in Doha, Qatar starting Nov. 26.\n\u2018Sharp Fall\u2019\n\u201cThe sharp price fall in ERU price reflects the expectation that a ban on some track 1 ERUs issued from May next year will urge countries, particularly Russia, to accelerate ERU issuance in the short-term,\u201d Chatterton said. \u201cThis causes selling pressure on ERUs and increases the level of swapping from CERs and EU allowances, placing selling pressure on these contracts as well.\u201d\nEU carbon permits for delivery in December dropped as much as 3.1 percent to 7.83 euros a metric ton and ended the session at 7.97 euros on ICE.\nThe previous version of the EU draft proposal, submitted to member states last month, sought to prohibit from the bloc\u2019s carbon-trading program the use of ERUs issued after 2012 by countries without a new set of binding emission targets. Several EU member states objected to the original amendment, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Oct. 1.\nIn the next phase of the EU carbon program, starting in 2013, offset credits can only be used if they are exchanged for EU allowances, according to rules to be set in the upcoming revision of the bloc\u2019s carbon registry regulation. Any changes to the regulation proposed by the commission need qualified- majority support from member states to pass.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Ewa Krukowska in Brussels at ekrukowska@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Lars Paulsson at lpaulsson@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:29:25", "post_time": "2012-10-19 12:50:52", "author": "Ewa Krukowska", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-19/eu-said-to-seek-ban-on-post-2012-carbon-offsets-from-russia.html", "title": "Carbon Offsets Tumble as EU Said to Eye Russian Credits Ban", "post_date": "2012-10-19", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IGBVL", "embers_id": "ff880de2005e395ac789bb0ed455fc18728adec9"}, {"content": "European Power Market Coupling May Be Delayed, Operator Says\nBy Torsten Fagerholm - 2012-10-19T12:07:11Z\nThe planned integration of power markets in the European Union may be delayed beyond 2014, according to CASC-CWE which handles auctions of transmission capacity in the region.\nMeeting that deadline depends on markets in northwest Europe being linked by the second quarter of next year, a process that is still subject to completion of tests and regulatory approvals, according to a presentation by the Capacity Allocation Service Company for Central West Europe.\n\u201cIf any of the above steps takes more time than estimated or cannot be successfully finalized, this will have an impact on the planning,\u201d Corne Meeuwis, CASC-CWE\u2019s chief executive officer, said in the presentation posted on the website of Norway \u2019s energy and water directorate.\nThe EU plans to merge the region\u2019s power markets by aligning regulation and expanding cross-border power trading and infrastructure by 2014, according to the European Commission.\nWhile integration plans in northwest Europe are being implemented on schedule, the project is now entering a challenging phase, Meeuwis said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Torsten Fagerholm in Helsinki at tfagerholm@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Lars Paulsson at lpaulsson@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:29:32", "post_time": "2012-10-19 08:07:11", "author": "Torsten Fagerholm", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-19/european-power-market-coupling-may-be-delayed-operator-says.html", "title": "European Power Market Coupling May Be Delayed, Operator Says", "post_date": "2012-10-19", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IGBVL", "embers_id": "cd948d6779df717aa4bff18f403533bba7404397"}, {"content": "EU Mulls Allowing Carbon Offset Swaps From May, Draft Shows\nBy Ewa Krukowska - 2012-10-02T15:01:40Z\nThe European Union is considering from May 1 allowing emitters to swap international carbon offsets into EU allowances eligible for compliance in the next phase of the region\u2019s emissions market.\nManufacturers, utilities and airlines in the EU program will be able to request until the end of March 2015 to swap offsets generated for emission reductions before 2012, the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s regulatory arm, said in a draft revision of the EU carbon registry regulation obtained by Bloomberg News . In the third phase of the EU emissions trading system, which starts next year, companies will need to exchange imported carbon-reduction credits into EU permits before surrendering them for compliance.\nInternational credits for cutting greenhouse gases from 2013 onward would be exchanged until the end of 2020, the commission said. The measure has been submitted to member states for talks and needs approval from governments.\nThe EU law allows about 12,000 factories and power plants in the bloc\u2019s emissions trading system to use United Nations offsets as a cheaper way to comply with pollution quotas. The rules of the program will tighten from next year when emitters will be permitted to use UN credits from new projects only as long as they are based in least developed countries.\nThe swapping allows companies with pollution limits in the world\u2019s largest emissions cap-and-trade system to manage their eligibility risk, according to Konrad Hanschmidt, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance in London .\nRemove Risk\n\u201cIn return for an offset a company will receive an EU allowance that they do not have to immediately submit for compliance,\u201d Hanschmidt said by e-mail today. \u201cIn essence that will remove the risk of holding credits that could become ineligible in the future.\u201d\nThe EU will from May prohibit the import of offsets from projects linked to industrial gases hydrofluorocarbon-23 and nitrous oxide from adipic acid production under the UN Clean Development Mechanism, according to a ban approved in 2011.\nThe draft revision of the EU registry regulation would also impose limits on the use of some Emission Reduction Units, or credits generated under the UN Joint Implementation mechanism, the document showed. The commission proposed to bar from holding in the registry ERUs issued from 2013 for JI projects based in countries without binding post-2012 emission targets, according to the document.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ewa Krukowska in Brussels at ekrukowska@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Lars Paulsson at lpaulsson@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:29:33", "post_time": "2012-10-02 11:01:40", "author": "Ewa Krukowska", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-02/eu-considers-allowing-carbon-offset-swaps-from-may-draft-shows.html", "title": "EU Mulls Allowing Carbon Offset Swaps From May, Draft Shows", "post_date": "2012-10-02", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IGBVL", "embers_id": "46dffe1b48eecc87cca789995028bfca7d35bb92"}, {"content": "Spain Adds $32 Billion Power-System Bailout to Bank Rescue\nBy Ben Sills - 2012-10-01T15:26:28Z\nAfter Spain\u2019s rescue of its banks and cash-strapped regions, the 2013 budget reveals a bailout of the power industry to cover 25 billion euros ($32 billion) of debt accumulated by the electricity system.\nThe spending blueprint released two days ago adds 100 billion euros to the nation\u2019s debt from the rescue packages by the end of 2012, driving its ratio to gross domestic product up 16.8 percentage points to 85.3 percent of total output.\nPower companies such as Iberdrola SA (IBE) and Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS) booked more revenue than they received from their clients for most of the past decade -- the difference between government-set prices for buyers and sellers -- with the shortfall booked as receivables on their balance sheets.\n\u201cPoliticians have failed to keep an appropriate distance from the industries they are supposed to regulate and when you look at the budget you see the impact,\u201d Jose Ignacio Torreblanca, head of the Madrid office of the European Council on Foreign Relations, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe government is taking on a whole series of debts and the power industry is a prime example.\u201d\nSpanish energy companies have recruited politicians from both main parties. Gas Natural has former Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez on its board. Endesa SA (ELE) \u2019s owner Enel SpA has former Finance Minister Pedro Solbes. Solbes\u2019s successor Elena Salgado joined Endesa Chile (ENDESA) as a director this year. Iberdrola has Angel Acebes, who was Interior Minister alongside Rajoy in the last People\u2019s Party administration.\nGas Natural rose as much as 4.3 percent today and traded 3 percent higher at 11.35 euros at 5:18 p.m. Endesa rose 2.3 percent compared with a 1.1 percent gain for the benchmark.\nDebt Repayments\nThe cost of repaying power debt added 2.1 billion euros to bills this year, driving up the annual deficit. The system\u2019s debts threatened to run out of control, Industry Minister Jose Manuel Soria said in July.\nSoria said Sept. 14 the government will cover repayments of power system debt this year alongside a package of tax increases on power companies to break the debt spiral.\nBudget Ministry spokesman Jesus Garcia declined to give further details of how Spain is accounting for the rescue or how much it contributed to the jump in borrowing.\nThe government already backed about 13 billion euros of the debt through a securitization program that began last year. The program took the debt off the balance sheets of utilities including Iberdrola and Enel SpA (ENEL) \u2019s Endesa SA unit by selling it to investors with a government guarantee. It didn\u2019t affect the overall indebtedness of the system.\nSpanish Bailouts\nSpain may borrow about 40 billion euros from the European Union to recapitalize its banks. It underwrote a 35 billion-euro program to bail out local and regional govvernments that hadn\u2019t paid their contractors. There\u2019s also an 18 billion-euro pot for regions including Catalonia and Andalucia that can\u2019t meet their obligations.\n\u201cThese are one-off measures that won\u2019t have any impact on the structural deficit,\u201d Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said at a press conference in Madrid today.\n-- Editors: James Hertling, Francis Harris\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Ben Sills in Madrid at bsills@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Hertling at jhertling@bloomberg.net\nSpain Adds $32 Billion Power-System Bailout to Rescue of Banks\nAngel Navarrete/Bloomberg\nPower companies such as Iberdrola SA and Gas Natural SDG SA booked more revenue than they received from their clients for most of the past decade - the difference between government-set prices for buyers and sellers - with the shortfall booked as receivables on their balance sheets.\nPower companies such as Iberdrola SA and Gas Natural SDG SA booked more revenue than they received from their clients for most of the past decade - the difference between government-set prices for buyers and sellers - with the shortfall booked as receivables on their balance sheets.

To smooth the transition and limit price shocks, the EU agreed to auction a total of 120 million Phase 3 permits this year.\nGermany, along with the U.K. and Poland , decided to opt out from a common platform to sell carbon. The 24 member states that chose to procure common infrastructure for their auctions decided earlier this year to appoint EEX to conduct the sales.\n\u201cThese auctions are expected to start by end-October, while the precise start date remains to be confirmed,\u201d the commission said in the statement. \u201cEEX, in its capacity as the common auction platform, intends to conduct auctions of general allowances on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\u201d\nThe U.K., which appointed the ICE Futures Europe exchange to carry out its carbon auctions, plans to sell Phase 3 permits on Nov. 21 and Dec. 5, according to the commission.\nNorway, Iceland\nPoland, which hasn\u2019t started a tender for its own auctioning venue yet, will sell allowances on the common platform, the commission said. Norway and Iceland , which participate in the bloc\u2019s emissions cap-and-trade program, also plan to use the EEX, according to the commission.\n\u201cFor auctioning on EEX, it is a prerequisite that the respective auctioneers are admitted to EEX and recognized by EEX\u2019s clearing house,\u201d it said. \u201cIf not ready in time for the first auction, the volumes of allowances for the member states concerned will be added as soon as all conditions are met.\u201d\nThe EU will also start this year selling a proportion of allowances for airlines, which became part of the ETS this year.\nUnder the preliminary calendar, Germany plans auctions of aviation allowances on Oct. 17 and Nov. 14 and the U.K. will sell permits for airlines on Nov. 26 and Dec. 10. Countries using the EEX as their common platform will sell aviation allowances \u201cmostly on Wednesdays and some on Mondays,\u201d according to the commission.\nGeneral Allowances\n\u201cThe final auction calendars for 2012 remain to be determined formally,\u201d it said. \u201cICE can do so only after the approval procedure for the U.K. platform has been completed. This is expected for early November.\u201d\nFrom 2013, EEX in its capacity as the common platform plans to continue weekly auctions of permits for manufacturers and utilities, known as general allowances, on Tuesdays and Thursdays and will hold weekly sales for Germany once a week on Friday, the commission said.\nICE intends to auction general allowances for the U.K. every two weeks, on Wednesday mornings, according to the preliminary calendar.\nBoth ICE and EEX would conduct sales of aviation permits \u201con certain other Wednesday mornings,\u201d the commission said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ewa Krukowska in Brussels at ekrukowska@bloomberg.net Alessandro Vitelli in London at avitelli1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Lars Paulsson at lpaulsson@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:29:37", "post_time": "2012-09-28 07:58:31", "author": "Aless,ro Vitelli , Ewa Krukowska", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-28/eu-agrees-on-preliminary-carbon-auction-schedule-from-october.html", "title": "EU Agrees on Preliminary Carbon Auction Schedule From October", "post_date": "2012-09-28", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IGBVL", "embers_id": "346e68007757cd31ee690651681b12c9d1eacc24"}, {"content": "EU Energy Regulator Group to Hire 10 People for Transparency\nBy Rachel Morison - 2012-09-27T10:18:51Z\nThe European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators will add 10 people next year to its staff of 43 to enforce EU rules to stop manipulation in the bloc\u2019s power and natural gas markets.\nACER plans to \u201cwork intensively\u201d on the Regulation for Energy Market Integrity and Transparency, or Remit, in 2013 and expects the framework of the rules to be in place by the beginning of 2014, the Ljubljana, Slovenia-based agency said in a work program published on its website yesterday.\nACER is due to publish guidance on how European utilities such as RWE AG (RWE) and GDF Suez SA (GSZ) should report data on power and natural gas outages under Remit by the end of September.\nThe agency may provide definitions of the data companies need to publish concerning plant outages and how quickly they are required to do so.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Rachel Morison in London at rmorison@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Lars Paulsson at lpaulsson@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:29:38", "post_time": "2012-09-27 06:18:51", "author": "Rachel Morison", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-27/eu-energy-regulator-group-to-hire-10-people-for-transparency.html", "title": "EU Energy Regulator Group to Hire 10 People for Transparency", "post_date": "2012-09-27", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IGBVL", "embers_id": "ac2f8bf7bc2a2e5e2e152e2874fcb89089bc4e18"}, {"content": "Peru\u2019s Ferreyros Raises $60 Million From Share Sale in Lima\nBy Alex Emery - 2012-02-08T14:39:33Z\nFerreyros SA (FERREYC1) , the Lima-based distributor for Caterpillar Inc.

(SRE)\nThe department commissioned the study last year to assess the economic impact of exports on domestic energy use after granting Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) permission to ship gas from Louisiana . It said future permits won\u2019t be issued until the study is completed.\nThe first part of the study is complete, and a second portion was scheduled to come out in the first quarter. That date was pushed back to late in the U.S. summer, which ends Sept. 22. A posting on the department website now says it will be \u201ccomplete by the end of the year.\u201d\n\u201cIt is really unfortunate, but I don\u2019t think anything happens until we see the results of that report,\u201d said Bill Cooper, president of the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, which advocates for gas shipments. The Washington-based group includes LNG producers, shippers and terminal operators.\n\u201cNone of the applicants, I\u2019m certain, want to see a delay in the regulatory process,\u201d Cooper said in an interview.\nThe study was started after lawmakers led by Representative Edward Markey , a Massachusetts Democrat, and Senator Ron Wyden , an Oregon Democrat, said overseas sales might increase domestic energy prices.\nThe delay probably will push release of the Energy Department\u2019s report until after the election in November.\n\u2018Complicated Analysis\u2019\n\u201cThis is a complicated economic analysis assessing a dynamic market,\u201d Jen Stutsman, an Energy Department spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. \u201cWe take our responsibility to issue these determinations seriously and want to make sure the necessary time is taken to get it right.\u201d\nInvestors including Sempra Energy in partnership with Mitsubishi Corp. and Mitsui & Co. Ltd., Freeport LNG with Macquarie Group Ltd., and Dominion Resources, have applied for approvals from the Energy Department.\nU.S. permits are required to sell gas to countries that aren\u2019t free-trade partners with the U.S., a group that includes Japan and Spain .\nAs natural-gas prices soared in the last decade, energy companies sought permission to build import terminals. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for natural gas has opened access to reserves that previously couldn\u2019t be produced economically, driving prices to a decade low and letting companies shift gears and seek overseas buyers for the fuel.\nIn fracking, oil and gas companies shoot a mixture of water, sand and chemicals underground to crack shale rock formations and free fossil fuels trapped inside.\nReuters reported on the delay yesterday.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jim Snyder in Washington at jsnyder24@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:30:43", "post_time": "2012-09-18 15:14:35", "author": "Jim Snyder", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-18/gas-export-study-delay-puts-u-s-projects-in-limbo-for-this-year.html", "title": "Gas-Export Study Delay Puts U.S. Projects in Limbo for This Year", "post_date": "2012-09-18", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IGBVL", "embers_id": "4cd4a0342c38dfe4acebf7e564192ddb285c1687"}, {"content": "U.S. Solar Industry Anticipates Utility Metering Backlash\nBy Christopher Martin - 2012-09-13T12:24:18Z\nSam Hodgson/Bloomberg\nAn installer secures a solar panel during installation at a home in Encinitas, California.\nThe growing use of rooftop solar systems are spurring concern that U.S. utilities may decline to purchase power generated by the panels, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association .\nUtilities are required to buy power generated by solar panels installed on consumers\u2019 homes under so-called net- metering policies, an arrangement that may become less viable as solar systems become more common, said Rhone Resch , chief executive officer of the Washington-based trade group.\nCalifornia , the largest solar market, capped the amount of panels utilities are mandated to connect to their grids and other states are considering similar policies.

He promoted alternatives to fossil fuels as a way to cut U.S. dependence on imported fuel. The 2009 economic-stimulus plan spent a record $90 billion on clean energy, creating 225,000 green jobs after one year, according to the White House.\nRepublicans have used U.S. support for Solyndra LLC, the solar-panel maker that collapsed two years after getting a $535 million U.S. loan guarantee, to depict Obama\u2019s policies as a failure by meddling in the free market. Mitt Romney , the Republican presidential nominee, said federal regulation of oil and gas limit U.S. energy development.\nZichal said the Interior Department is working on a \u201ccommon-sense rule\u201d to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. The proposal, which would require disclosure of chemicals used in fracking, can be revised with help from energy companies, in the way the Environmental Protection Agency revised standards in April to combat air pollution from drilling.\nThe EPA rule gave companies until 2015 to meet emission requirements, responding to industry opposition to a proposed 60-day deadline.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Katarzyna Klimasinska in Washington at kklimasinska@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:30:51", "post_time": "2012-09-06 15:28:57", "author": "Kasia Klimasinska", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-06/renewable-energy-is-obama-goal-for-next-term-aide-says.html", "title": "Renewable Energy Is Obama Goal for Next Term, Aide Says", "post_date": "2012-09-06", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IGBVL", "embers_id": "642a70ebb62b22c0c0af8d57b0b9e04149451ae1"}, {"content": "First Solar Stops Installation at Agua Caliente Project\nBy Christopher Martin and Justin Doom - 2012-08-30T21:20:35Z\nFirst Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the biggest U.S. solar manufacturer, halted panel deliveries to the world\u2019s largest photovoltaic power plant, which it\u2019s building in Arizona , because construction is ahead of schedule and the company must slow down to meet contractual milestones.\nFirst Solar won\u2019t ship additional modules until January to the $1.8 billion Agua Caliente project and won\u2019t install panels currently sitting on the ground at the site, said Fred Pech, the power plant\u2019s construction manager. The solar farm is scheduled for completion at the end of 2013 and is 85 percent built.\nThe company, based in Tempe, Arizona, accelerated construction on Agua Caliente this year to use panels it produced as far away as Germany and Malaysia amid a global glut. Now it\u2019s diverting shipments to other projects to prevent inventories from piling up, said Aaron Chew, an analyst at Maxim Group LLC in New York.\nFirst Solar delivered panels to the project \u201cbecause it was more profitable,\u201d Chew said today in a telephone interview. \u201cThey overdid Agua Caliente.\u201d Expanding its focus on power plants helped make First Solar the only profitable solar company in the Bloomberg Industries Global Large Solar Index in the the second quarter.\nThe shutdown probably won\u2019t affect First Solar\u2019s earnings this year, Chew said. \u201cHowever, it does highlight the extent to which they\u2019re pulling things forward, with bigger risks in 2013 and 2014.\u201d\nThe decision to wind down installation for this year may be \u201crelated to contractors and construction crew, perhaps minimum number of hours,\u201d Chew said.\nFirst Solar shares fell 19 percent to $19.67 at the close in New York .\nLast Module\n\u201cWe installed the last module for block 10 on Monday,\u201d Pech said in an interview yesterday a the plant, located on 2,400 acres of desert about 120 miles (193 kilometers) west of Phoenix. There are two more blocks of panels planned for the site and \u201cwe could be done by the end of this year, but we\u2019re way ahead of schedule.\u201d\nDozens of boxes of unused panels are piled up at the site, covered in blue tarps to prevent degradation over the next four months while First Solar waits to resume installation.\nThe company has shifted panel deliveries to other solar projects, Ted Meyer, a spokesman, said in an e-mail today. There are about 200 workers at the Agua Caliente site doing work other than installing panels.\nBiggest Plant\nWith 85 percent of its panels installed, Agua Caliente has about 247 megawatts of capacity, making it the the world\u2019s largest operating solar farm. PG&E Corp. (PCG) \u2019s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is buying the power under a 25-year agreement.\nThe power plant was generating 249 megawatts of electricity yesterday at 11:30 a.m. local time and its output has reached as much as 251.3 megawatts under ideal sunlight conditions, Pech said.\nThe project received a $967 million loan guarantee from the U.S Energy Department in August 2011 and was expected to create 400 construction jobs and 10 permanent positions, according to the agency\u2019s website . Damien LaVera, an agency spokesman, said the guarantee doesn\u2019t include any specific requirements regarding construction or employment.\nThe plant is owned by NRG Energy Inc. (NRG) and MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. Lori Neuman, an NRG spokeswoman, and Ann Thelen , a MidAmerican spokeswoman, didn\u2019t return phone calls today.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Christopher Martin in New York at cmartin11@bloomberg.net ; Justin Doom in New York at jdoom1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Reed Landberg at landberg@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:30:52", "post_time": "2012-08-30 17:20:35", "author": "Christopher Martin , Justin Doom", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-30/first-solar-stops-installation-at-agua-caliente-project.html", "title": "First Solar Stops Installation at Agua Caliente Project", "post_date": "2012-08-30", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IGBVL", "embers_id": "42d09128f5ebb82b4a64c3c1913a1dec655866b0"}, {"content": "S&P 500 Dividend Health, Forecast Changes for Aug. 14\nBy Stephen Rose - 2012-08-14T11:51:49Z\nThe following table details daily changes in dividend forecasts and dividend health scores for companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Demand will exceed supply by 7,000 metric tons next year, equal to about 60 percent of global stockpiles tracked by the London Metal Exchange, Barclays Plc estimates. Futures will average $22,000 a ton in the fourth quarter, 17 percent more than the price of $18,740 today, according to the median of 12 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nTin tumbled as much as 32 percent this year on concern that slowdowns from the U.S. to China to Europe will cut demand for the metal used in everything from cans to televisions and smart phones. Smelters in Indonesia, representing about 40 percent of global exports, started shutting down this month. That may help reduce the nation\u2019s output by as much as 14 percent in 2012, according to St. Albans , England-based ITRI Ltd. The research group also expects a supply deficit in 2013.\n\u201cMost smelters have closed,\u201d said Hidayat Arsani, the president of the Indonesian Tin Mining Association. \u201cThe price just cannot cover the cost. Ideally, the price should be around $21,000 or $22,000 a ton. If this continues, we can\u2019t work anymore.\u201d\nNickel Slumped\nMetal for delivery in three months, the LME\u2019s benchmark contract, fell 18 percent in the past year. Of the bourse\u2019s six main industrial metals, only nickel and aluminum slumped more. The Standard & Poor\u2019s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities gained 4.3 percent and the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities advanced 13 percent. Treasuries returned 3.3 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.\nIndonesian smelters also curbed production at the end of last year as prices fell as much as 44 percent in eight months. LME-monitored inventories declined 43 percent in the fourth quarter, the most since 2004. Futures rallied 19 percent in the first three months of this year before retreating once more.\nLME stockpiles are shrinking again, reaching 11,630 tons today, 50 percent less than a year ago. Canceled warrants, or orders to remove metal from warehouses, jumped to 6,350 tons on Aug. 14, the most since 1997, suggesting users are soaking up inventory, bourse data show. Barclays and Morgan Stanley estimate the market is in a third year of deficit.\nLargest Producer\nAny rebound would boost profit for PT Timah, (TINS) the world\u2019s third-largest producer. Shares of the Pangkalpinang, Bangka Belitung-based company slumped 40 percent in the past year in Jakarta trading and will rally 17 percent to 1,521.25 rupiah in the next 12 months, according to the average of eight analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nSlowing growth remains the biggest risk to tin, a market valued at $9.3 billion last year based on consumption. China, which represents about 47 percent of demand, expanded at the slowest pace in three years in the second quarter, and export growth in July collapsed to 1 percent from 11.3 percent in June. The 17-nation euro area contracted 0.2 percent in the second quarter after stagnating in the first three months.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very pessimistic about consumption,\u201d said Sun Si, an analyst at Beijing Antaike Information Development Co., which has researched industrial metals for two decades. \u201cMacro- economic risks remain, and while we expect an improvement from the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter, it may not be significant.\u201d\nHistorical Volatility\nForecasting tin prices may be harder than for other industrial metals because the volume is lower and price swings are common. The LME handled 157,296 tin futures and options last month, compared with 5.1 million for aluminum and 3.1 million for copper. Its 100-day historical volatility is at 26.4 percent, making it the second most-volatile after nickel, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nWhile a Bloomberg survey of 15 traders and analysts in June 2011 predicted a gain of about 15 percent to $30,000 by the end of the year, futures declined 27 percent. A separate survey in January anticipated a 20 percent gain to $26,000 this year. Prices advanced to $25,880 the next month, then retreated.\nExports from Indonesia dropped 6.4 percent to 55,613 tons in the first seven months of this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Companies in Bangka-Belitung produced about 80,000 tons last year, out of a national total of 105,000 tons, according to data from the government and ITRI, which is predicting a contraction of as much as 15,000 tons in 2012.\nGlobal Stockpiles\nNext year\u2019s predicted shortage may cut the ratio of global stockpiles to consumption to a record low of 1.7 weeks, from 2.6 weeks in 2012 and more than seven weeks in 2009, Barclays estimates. The bank expects world output to gain 0.3 percent to 354,000 tons in 2013, from growth of 0.6 percent in 2012.\nGlobal mine supply fell 6 percent in the first five months and a second-half recovery is unlikely unless prices rally, according to Credit Suisse Group AG. Chinese output fell 4 percent to 82,471 tons in the first seven months, according to government data. Exports also may be disrupted by the nationalization of Glencore International Plc\u2019s (GLEN) Colquiri tin and zinc operations in Bolivia and violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to Barclays.\nPT DS Jaya Abadi, one of the Indonesian smelters that curbed output, sent its 150 workers on leave until September, according to Sukito Gunawan, a director of the company. The producer in Pangkalpinang will review its options again that month, he said.\nBreaking Up\nSmall-scale miners in Bangka-Belitung, who supply smelters with ore, have also stopped work. Ari Saputra, 22, said that his boss ordered a halt to mining at Batu Belubang beach more than a month ago, and he now earns a living breaking up the bamboo rafts used for dredging ore. The crews extract ore offshore and from riverbeds.\nSpeculation that policy makers in China and the U.S. will take more measures to support growth may lift prices, according to David Wilson , an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in London. The Federal Open Market Committee said Aug. 1 it will pump in fresh stimulus if needed to boost economic growth and create jobs. China reduced interest rates twice this year, and has cut banks\u2019 reserve requirements three times since November.\nNet Income\nPT Timah will report an 8 percent gain in net income to 968.14 billion rupiah ($101.8 million) this year before profit drops 12 percent to 852.8 billion rupiah in 2013, the mean of as many as 12 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows. President Director Sukrisno said in an interview in Jakarta on Aug. 3 that Timah will slow tin sales to the spot market this year and expand stockpiles.\n\u201cWe are surviving,\u201d said Gunawan, the director at DS Jaya Abadi, who estimates monthly output this year averaged 300 tons out of capacity of 800 tons. \u201cSome say that $17,700 is already the bottom and it will rebound again but it will depend on the European economy. If there\u2019s no concrete action, and meanwhile China is reducing consumption, it may stay as it is.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Yoga Rusmana in Jakarta at yrusmana@bloomberg.net ; Maria Kolesnikova in London at mkolesnikova@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Poole at jpoole4@bloomberg.net\nBear Market in Tin Shuts 70% of Indonesian Capacity\nDimas Ardian/Bloomberg\nWorkers cast tin ingots at the PT Timah tin plant in Pangkal Pinang, Bangka Island, Indonesia.

The rally has narrowed the yield gap with similar-maturity debt from Rio de Janeiro-based Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) to 146 basis points from 165 basis points last week, when Fernandez refused Chaco province\u2019s request for the dollars it needed to pay local debt.\nPetrobras Argentina \u2019s borrowing costs are falling faster than the average for Argentine companies as the oil producer\u2019s debt is backed by its Brazilian parent, giving investors more confidence the notes will be repaid, according to Capital Markets Argentina. Average yields on international government bonds have dropped seven basis points this week to 10.56 percent, JPMorgan Chase & Co. data show.\nPetrobras Argentina\u2019s bonds are \u201cguaranteed by Petrobras Brazil and it\u2019s been punished, so that has created an opportunity,\u201d Noelia Lucini, a portfolio manager at Capital Markets, said in a telephone interview from Buenos Aires. \u201cThe news in the last two weeks aroused uncertainty.\u201d\nBrazil Guarantee\nA press official at Buenos Aires-based Petrobras Argentina who asked not to be identified in accordance with company policy declined to comment on the bonds.\nBonds of Brazil\u2019s state-controlled oil company, known as Petrobras, are rated A3 by Moody\u2019s, three steps above investment grade and the same rating as the 2017 bonds issued by its Argentine unit.\nThe $300 million of notes due in 2017 are supported by a purchase agreement provided by Petrobras, which requires the parent company to pay bondholders in case of a default and \u201cis designed to function in a manner similar to a guarantee,\u201d according to the bonds\u2019 prospectus.\nThe backing should keep the borrowing costs of Petrobras Argentina, the nation\u2019s fourth-largest oil producer, low, with yields of about 50 basis points more than those of the parent company on average, according to Jim Harper, director of corporate research at BCP Securities LLC.\nCurrency Restrictions\nMoody\u2019s lowered Petrobras Argentina\u2019s outlook to negative on Sept. 28 after doing the same for the Argentine government, citing Fernandez\u2019s \u201chaphazard policies.\u201d A month earlier, the company\u2019s rating had been cut to B1, reflecting the risk of further government intervention in the oil industry following the expropriation of oil-producer YPF SA (YPFD) in April.\nSince her re-election a year ago, Fernandez banned dollar purchases for savings, real estate and the repayment of debt issued under local law by provinces and companies in a bid to slow capital flight and preserve foreign reserves.\nArgentine corporate debt lost 1.04 percent last week, the biggest weekly loss since June 29, according to JPMorgan\u2019s CEMBI index. The selloff also spread to local and international law government bonds.\nAn investment surge into emerging-market notes in September on the back of stimulus measures by policy makers in the U.S., Europe and Japan means that some bondholders are less likely to understand the terms of their debt contracts, according to Jack Deino, a portfolio manager at Invesco Inc.\nMoney managers increased their investments in emerging- market bonds by $1.9 billion in September to $6.5 billion, according to research company EPFR Global.\n\u2018Bite You\u2019\n\u201cHalf the guys that are buying these deals are not even reading the indentures or the covenants or the prospectuses or anything,\u201d Deino said at Fitch Ratings\u2019 Fifth Annual Emerging Markets Conference in New York on Oct. 16. \u201cThat can come back to bite you.\u201d\nIn addition to Chaco\u2019s $26.7 million of bonds due in 2015 and 2023, other securities subject to the measures include $96.7 million of Tucuman province bonds due in 2015 and 2020 and $41.4 million of debt sold by the province of Formosa due in 2022, according to Buenos Aires-based research company Economia & Regiones SA.\nChaco, a soy bean-producing region in the north of Argentina, will swap its dollar-denominated debt for peso bonds, Governor Jorge Capitanich said in an Oct. 17 interview on CN23 while recommending that other provinces follow his lead.\nProvinces Cut\nMoody\u2019s lowered the credit ratings for Chaco, Formosa and eight other provinces and municipalities on Oct. 17, citing difficulties in obtaining foreign currency. The ratings company cut the foreign-currency credit ratings to Caa1, seven steps below investment grade, for the provinces of Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Mendoza, as well as the city of Buenos Aires.\nArgentina made a $200 million debt payment Oct. 17 on domestic law bonds due 2017, Fernandez said that day. The Argentine government and issuers that sold bonds under international law can still get dollars to repay creditors, according to the central bank.\nWith the lowest yields among 34 Argentine corporate bonds tracked by Bloomberg, Petrobras Argentina\u2019s bonds aren\u2019t paying investors enough to offset the risk associated with investing in Argentina, according to Mario Rappoport, a managing director at Gleacher & Co.\nLowest Yields\n\u201cIn Argentina, you have headline risk and you have it constantly,\u201d Rappoport said in a telephone interview from New York. \u201cI understand it\u2019s Petrobras, fully owned, but at this spread, it doesn\u2019t make that much sense to take the risk.\u201d\nThe gap over Petrobras\u2019s bonds due in 2018 soared to 636 basis points in April, when Fernandez seized a controlling stake in YPF from Madrid-based Repsol SA. (REP) That\u2019s a signal that investors should demand an interest rate of at least 225 basis points more than that of the parent company before buying Petrobras Argentina\u2019s bonds, Rappoport said.\nThe extra yield investors demand to hold Argentine government dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 851 basis points at 12:36 p.m. in Buenos Aires, according to JPMorgan\u2019s EMBI Global index.\nThe cost of protecting Argentine debt against non-payment for five years with credit-default swaps rose eight basis points to 979 basis points, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or cash if a government or company fails to comply with debt agreements.\nWeaker Peso\nWarrants tied to Argentina\u2019s economic growth rose 0.01 cent to 12.64 cents. The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 4.7369 per dollar.\nInvestors who own Petrobras\u2019s securities should consider switching into Petrobras Argentina\u2019s bonds, according to BCP\u2019s Harper. The Argentine unit\u2019s notes are as safe as those of the parent and offer a higher yield, according to BCP\u2019s Harper.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to emphasize this is Petrobras risk,\u201d he said by telephone from Greenwich, Connecticut . \u201cIt\u2019s not Argentina risk. To the extent that that spread has widened, it\u2019s even more compelling to swap from one into the other.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Katia Porzecanski in New York at kporzecansk1@bloomberg.net ; Drew Benson in New York at abenson9@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Papadopoulos at papadopoulos@bloomberg.net ; Michael Tsang at mtsang1@bloomberg.net\nMoody\u2019s lowered Petrobras Argentina\u2019s outlook to negative on Sept. 28 after doing the same for the Argentine government, citing President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner\u2019s \u201chaphazard policies.\u201d Photographer: Paul J.

Hinrichsen SA.\nThe new rate distributors pay for biodiesel will probably be about 4,660 Argentine pesos ($994) a ton, making it hard for small producers to operate profitably after prices rose for soybean oil that\u2019s used as a feedstock, Thomas Hinrichsen, who runs J.J. Hinrichsen in Buenos Aires, said today in a telephone interview.\nThe government reduced prices in August to guarantee a cheap supply of local biodiesel for YPF SA (YPF) , the oil company it nationalized from Spain \u2019s Repsol SA (REP) in April that buys about two-thirds of the country\u2019s domestically consumed output, Matias Stengel, Argentina regional manager at ED&F Man Holdings Ltd., said today in a telephone interview.\n\u201cYPF is a now a state-controlled company,\u201d Stengel said. Before the YPF takeover, \u201cthe bill for biodiesel was paid by\u201d oil companies such as Repsol, Exxon Mobile Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. \u201cNow it will be paid by the government.\u201d\nLowering the price cuts expenses for YPF while driving down profits for producers. At 4,660 pesos a ton, \u201csmaller plants would find it difficult to survive,\u201d Stengel said. The government is not seeking to undermine the entire industry and will probably announce a higher price that\u2019s adequate to support producers, he said.\nBiodiesel currently sells for 4,405 pesos a ton, down from 5,196 pesos in July.\nExport Duties\nPresident Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced Sept. 19 a new formula for calculating biodiesel prices, and cut to 19.1 percent the export tariff that\u2019s partly aimed at ensuring adequate local supplies. Argentina imposed a 24 percent export duty on the fuel in August. The rate will now be revised every 15 days.\nArgentina is the world\u2019s largest exporter of soybean biodiesel and mixes 7 percent of the fuel with regular diesel.\n\u201cThe August price killed the domestic market,\u201d Stengel said. \u201cThey want to create a new, flexible way of maintaining a cheap price that\u2019s good enough for the industry to survive.\u201d\nThe price cut was especially hard on small producers that don\u2019t make their own soybean oil , Ariel Scaparro, president of the biodiesel company Biocombustibles & Energias Alternativas ALS SA, said in a telephone interview.\n\u2018Impossible\u2019 Price\nThere are 17 small and mid-sized biodiesel producers in Argentina, which \u201cneed a price over 5,200 pesos to cover their costs,\u201d Scaparro said. The August rate cut \u201chas made it impossible to continue for most companies.\u201d\nBiocombustibles & Energias, based in Buenos Aires, may stop construction on its first two refineries and may scrap plans to build two more because they won\u2019t be profitable at the current price, he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a U-turn of policy regarding the government\u2019s treatment of biodiesel,\u201d Scaparro said. \u201cThe industry is on the verge of closing.\u201d\nYPF, based in Buenos Aires , didn\u2019t reply to phone messages and e-mail today.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Stephan Nielsen in Sao Paulo at snielsen8@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Reed Landberg at landberg@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:32:01", "post_time": "2012-09-21 15:37:00", "author": "Stephan Nielsen", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/argentina-biofuel-price-won-t-restore-producers-profits.html", "title": "Argentina Biofuel Price Won\u2019t Restore Producers\u2019 Profits", "post_date": "2012-09-21", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IGBVL", "embers_id": "1f3e2bc7c1dc191aa03f94e3730efc294f27852d"}, {"content": "Chariot Oil & Gas Plans More Namibia Wells After Two Dry Holes\nBy Brian Swint - 2012-09-21T06:52:13Z\nChariot Oil & Gas Ltd.

The benchmark note yield dropped for the first time in five days as a U.S. industry report showed purchases of existing houses fell. Stocks slid the most since June.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the unwinding from the pressure we saw in the market all week,\u201d said Sean Murphy , a trader at Societe Generale SA in New York, one of the 21 primary dealers that deal with the Federal Reserve . \u201cSome of the headlines out of the European Union summit don\u2019t seem so encouraging.

The 10-year term premium, a model created by economists at the Fed that includes expectations for interest rates , growth and inflation, was negative 0.81 percent today, after closing at negative 0.76 percent yesterday, the least costly level since Aug. 21. A negative reading indicates investors are willing to accept yields below what\u2019s considered fair value. The average for the past 10 years is 0.44 percent. The all-time low was negative 1.02 percent on July 24.\n\u2018Range Trade\u2019\nA measure of stress in U.S. credit markets, which falls when investors favor assets such as corporate bonds and rises when they seek the perceived safety of government securities , rebounded from a record low level on an intraday basis reached earlier this week.\nThe U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, the difference between the two-year swap rate and the comparable-maturity Treasury yield, widened to 10.5 basis points today after narrowing to eight basis points on Oct. 17 in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the least on an intraday basis since Bloomberg started keeping data in November 1988. It is down from a 2012 high of 49.3 basis points on Jan. 3.\nHome Sales\nSales of previously owned U.S. homes, tabulated when a contract closes, decreased in September 1.7 percent to a 4.75 million annual rate, matching the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, figures from the National Association of Realtors showed today in Washington . The median prices from a year earlier jumped by the most since 2005 as inventories dwindled.\nThe Fed sold $1.09 billion of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities today due from April 2014 to January 2016. The central bank is swapping short-term Treasuries in its holdings for longer-term securities to put downward pressure on borrowing costs, part of its efforts to spur the economy.\nBidders in a $7 billion sale of 30-year inflation-indexed securities yesterday accepted a record-low yield of 0.479 percent for securities that guard against the threat of rising consumer prices.\nThe difference between yields on 10-year notes and same- maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the debt, was 2.50 percentage points. The average over the past decade is 2.17 percentage points.\n\u2018Political Will\u2019\nIn Brussels, Merkel said it\u2019s an open question whether European policy makers can meet the deadline they\u2019d set hours earlier to establish a euro-area bank supervisor by year-end.\n\u201cThere are complicated questions to clarify and we\u2019ll see in December if we complete it or not,\u201d Merkel told reporters after a two-day European Union summit wrapped up today. \u201cFor now, the political will is there.\u201d\nThe European Central Bank is set become the currency zone\u2019s main financial supervisor by Jan. 1, raising the prospect of direct aid to Spain\u2019s banks during 2013, the 27 EU leaders agreed at the gathering.

Indian shares gained as JPMorgan Chase & Co. upgraded the nation\u2019s equities.\nA preliminary reading for a purchasing managers\u2019 index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed China\u2019s manufacturing may shrink this month. Euro-area services and manufacturing output contracted for a fifth month in June, suggesting the economy may fail to grow in the current quarter.

The Fed just did the bare minimum with simply an extension of the operation twist.\u201d\nChina PMI\nThe 48.1 preliminary reading for Chinese PMI compares with a final 48.4 for May. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. If confirmed on July 2, it would equal the run of below-50 readings from August 2008 to March 2009. A composite index based on a survey of purchasing managers in both manufacturing and services industries in the 17-nation euro area was stable at 46, the same reading as in May, Markit said.\nThe Philadelphia Fed\u2019s general economic index fell to minus 16.6 in June, the lowest level since August, from minus 5.8 the previous month. Economists forecast the gauge would improve to zero, the dividing line between growth and contraction, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.\nThe MSCI Emerging Markets gauge has added 1.7 percent in 2012 and trades at a multiple of 10.1 times estimated earnings, compared with 11.9 for companies on the developed-nation index, which has gained 2.1 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nAll 10 industry groups on the MSCI gauge declined, with energy and information technology leading the retreat.

Borrowed shares of top Brazilian producer Gerdau SA (GGBR4) is 3.45 percent, while the ratio for Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA (SID) is 4.51 percent.\nShrinking demand from the auto industry and a local currency decline that\u2019s inflating the cost of its dollar debt are hurting Usiminas, whose preferred shares fell 46 percent in the past 12 months. After net debt surged about 70 percent in March from a year earlier, Usiminas may sell new equity if debt ratios continue deteriorating, Bank of America Corp. analysts said in a June 5 note to customers.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no other way than selling shares and increasing capital if Usiminas wants to keep its investment plans,\u201d Jose Luiz Garcia, who helps manage 3.2 billion reais ($1.6 billion) at Rio de Janeiro-based Mercatto Gestao de Recursos, said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhat we see is a company with low margins, high debt and few prospects of earnings improvement.\u201d\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service lowered Usiminas\u2019s credit rating two levels to Ba2 on May 10, making it the first Brazilian company to lose its investment grade this year. The downgrade reflects the \u201ccontinued deterioration\u201d in the company\u2019s operating results, Moody\u2019s said in a statement at the time.\nUsiminas, based in Belo Horizonte , declined to comment on this article when contacted by Bloomberg News.\nHighest Valuation\nUsiminas is trading 28.5 times analysts\u2019 earnings estimates for this year, the highest of local rivals and No. 3 among 15 global peers tracked by Bloomberg. Gerdau trades at 13.7 times estimates and CSN at 9.8.\nOf the 20 analysts who rate the preferred stock and are tracked by Bloomberg, 11 advise clients to sell, while six say hold and three recommend buying Usiminas shares. Three others have put their ratings under review. The company will post 2012 profit excluding some items of 205.5 million reais, the average of 10 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey . That would be the lowest annual profit since 2002, when Usiminas had a 367.5 million-real loss before some items.\nUsiminas tumbled to an eight-year low on June 19 after Deutsche Bank AG cut the stock to sell, citing \u201cdeteriorating earnings,\u201d and Sao Paulo-based Valor Economico newspaper reported that the company may sell shares and assets to raise at least 1.5 billion reais of additional capital. The stock slid 2 percent to 6.90 reais at 10:27 a.m. in Sao Paulo today.\n\u2018Complex Situation\u2019\nRegulations in Brazil prohibit so-called naked short selling, when traders short shares without actually taking possession of them. Investors in Brazil borrow stock to use for short-selling, hedging and tax purposes. Short selling allows traders to profit from drops by selling stock and buying it later at a lower price.\n\u201cUsiminas is in a very difficult and complex situation, and this is reflected in the figures,\u201d Usiminas Chief Executive Officer Julian Eguren said on an April 24 conference call with analysts.\nAn 11 percent decline in the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar in the 12 months ended March 31 caused Usiminas\u2019s foreign-currency debt to balloon, prompting the company to ask bondholders to renegotiate clauses that can trigger an early payment. Local bondholders approved the waiver in a June 11 meeting.\nDilution\nUsiminas committed to keeping local debt less than 4.7 billion reais, dollar debt under $2.2 billion and a cash position of at least 3.5 billion reais. Usiminas had 8.78 billion reais in debt as of March 31, with about 46 percent of it denominated in U.S. dollars, according to an April 23 company statement.\nUsiminas\u2019 preferred shares lost 2.2 percent to 7.04 reais yesterday, extending its decline during 2012 to 31 percent. Porto Alegre-based Gerdau gained 21 percent in the period and Sao Paulo-based CSN dropped 18 percent. The Brazilian benchmark Bovespa index is up 0.7 percent this year. Usiminas\u2019s voting shares, the index\u2019s worst performer this year, fell 45 percent.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think it is worth it for investors to build a position in Usiminas now,\u201d Daniella Maia, chief analyst at brokerage Ativa SA CTV in Rio de Janeiro , said in a telephone interview yesterday. \u201cIf a new share sale really happens, current shareholders will be very diluted.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Juan Pablo Spinetto in Rio de Janeiro at jspinetto@bloomberg.net ; Denyse Godoy in Sao Paulo at dgodoy2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jessica Brice at jbrice1@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:33:20", "post_time": "2012-06-21 09:28:49", "author": "Juan Pablo Spinetto , Denyse Godoy", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-21/short-sellers-target-brazil-s-usiminas-as-debt-balloons.html", "title": "Short Sellers Target Brazil\u2019s Usiminas as Debt Balloons", "post_date": "2012-06-21", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IGBVL", "embers_id": "edc7fca3eb472788d8d43b3d3e9acb2734335489"}, {"content": "Emerging Stocks Rise From 5-Month Low; Rail Shares Gain\nBy Jason Webb - 2012-05-22T09:15:39Z\nSentiment among investors in emerging-market equities has reached \u201cpanic\u201d levels after a 15 percent price drop in three months, although this is a sign stocks may rise in the next six months, Citigroup Inc. said.\nEmerging-market stocks have advanced an average 7.5 percent in six months and 23 percent in a year on past occasions when Citigroup\u2019s \u201cWhether Vane\u201d has been at such levels, New-York- based analysts Geoffrey Dennis, Howard Park and Christina Wood wrote in an e-mailed note to clients dated yesterday.\nThe \u201cWhether Vane\u201d measures the VIX Index of volatility as well as the ratio of put options to call options and commodity prices, they said.\nCitigroup lowered its recommendation on the MSCI Emerging Markets Index to neutral in a May 18 report, saying the gauge is no longer likely to outperform global equities amid concerns about the European debt turmoil.\nThe developing-nations gauge has fallen 15 percent from its year-high on March 2.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jason Webb in London at jwebb25@bloomberg.net .\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Gavin Serkin at gserkin@bloomberg.net .\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:33:22", "post_time": "2012-05-22 05:15:39", "author": "Jason Webb", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-21/emerging-stocks-rise-from-5-month-low-chinese-rail-stocks-gain.html", "title": "Emerging Stocks Rise From 5-Month Low; Rail Shares Gain", "post_date": "2012-05-22", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IGBVL", "embers_id": "60882c7576a4f7e1245a44dfd1a985872ff60338"}, {"content": "Canadian Stocks Fall Amid Concerns About Global Economic Growth\nBy Matt Walcoff - 2011-08-18T20:51:00Z\nCanadian stocks fell, led by energy producers, after the U.S. reported bigger increases in initial jobless claims and consumer prices than most economists had forecast and Morgan Stanley cut its forecast for global growth.\nSuncor Energy Inc.

(QUX) , which mines copper in the U.S., Canada and Chile, soared 13 percent, the most since July 2009, to C$15.59 after analysts at Royal Bank of Canada and TD raised their ratings on the shares to \u201coutperform\u201d and \u201cbuy,\u201d respectively.\nIn a note to clients, Greg Barnes , an analyst at TD, cited a higher net asset value estimate for Quadra FNX\u2019s Victoria project in Ontario.\nMagna International Inc.

Most orders are coming in the mid- to low-end of the price range , said two people familiar with the matter, who declined to be named because the details are private. A final price hasn\u2019t been set, they said.\nStrong demand for the stock is a relief for Madrid-based Telefonica, which is seeking to sell the shares as part of a bid to gain funds to reduce debt . Telefonica said this week it plans to sell almost a quarter of the German business in the IPO, raising as much as 1.68 billion euros ($2.2 billion).\n\u201cThis shows how the deal is very attractive to investors even if the valuation was regarded as higher than its peers,\u201d Andres Bolumburu, an analyst at Banco de Sabadell in Madrid, said by phone today. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely good news for the company because it erases all doubts about a potential failure of the IPO.\u201d\nTelefonica, Spain \u2019s biggest phone company, is offering as many as 258.8 million shares of Telefonica Deutschland at 5.25 euros to 6.50 euros each. The IPO values the German business at as much as 7.3 billion euros.\nA Telefonica official in Madrid declined to comment.\nMeeting Investors\nDemand for the shares came at prices across the range offered, with funds from France, Switzerland and Spain among those seeking them, said a person with knowledge of the matter. The company\u2019s management will meet more investors in Europe and the U.S. next week, the person said, asking not to be named as the details are confidential.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS AG are managing the IPO, with help from Bank of America Corp., BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc.\nIPOs in Europe, the Middle East and Africa have raised about $8 billion this year, compared with $37 billion in the same period in 2011 as market volatility caused by Europe \u2019s sovereign debt crisis slowed the pace of sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nTelefonica shares fell 2.3 percent to close at 10.60 euros in Madrid, valuing the company at 48.2 billion euros.\nChief Executive Officer Cesar Alierta is selling assets, including Telefonica\u2019s German and Latin American businesses, as he seeks to avert a further debt-rating cut. With more than 58 billion euros of net debt, Telefonica is Europe\u2019s most indebted phone operator.\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service yesterday confirmed Telefonica\u2019s long-term debt rating of Baa2, the second-lowest investment grade, with a negative outlook. Standard & Poor\u2019s said last week it may reduce Telefonica\u2019s BBB rating, equivalent to Moody\u2019s, citing the company\u2019s exposure to Spain\u2019s sovereign risks.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Manuel Baigorri in Madrid at mbaigorri@bloomberg.net ; Ruth David in London at rdavid9@bloomberg.net ; Francesca Cinelli in Milan at fcinelli@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:33:50", "post_time": "2012-10-19 13:28:14", "author": "Manuel Baigorri, Ruth David , Francesca Cinelli", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-19/telefonica-s-german-unit-has-buyers-for-all-shares-in-ipo.html", "title": "Telefonica\u2019s German Unit Has Buyers for All Shares in IPO", "post_date": "2012-10-19", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IGBVL", "embers_id": "4a48b108bb03190d1938e6203fa9a19068fc6793"}, {"content": "Arbitrage Profit in U.S. Takeovers Pending on Feb. 10\nBy Terry Barrett - 2011-02-10T13:12:29Z\nFeb. 10 (Bloomberg) --The following table shows the potential arbitrage profit in pending takeover bids for U.S. companies ranked by premium.

The company, which must make interest payments in October, may make a decision on the sale in the coming days, the person said.\nThe company had a net loss of 89.4 million pesos ($20.6 million) in the first quarter compared with a profit of 252 million pesos a year ago. Edenor bonds that mature in 2022 have dropped 43.1 cents on the dollar, to 37.15 cents this year, sending the yield to a 29.4 percent. Borrowing costs for Latin American utilities fell 20 basis points to 5.88 percent over the same period, according to Credit Suisse AG\u2019s LABI index.\nExtension Sought\nEdenor sold Empresa Distribuidora San Luis SA for $27 million to Rovella Carranza in September and Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad de Salta SA to Salta Inversiones Electricas, known as Siesa, in April.\nAndes Energia, which has an option to buy 78 percent of Edelar for $20.2 million, last month sought a second extension of the option period. Edenor\u2019s board is scheduled to discuss the extension request in a meeting next week. Siesa may buy Edelar if the Andes arrangement fails, the person said.\nPagano left Edenor in April for \u201cpersonal reasons,\u201d the company said in statement to the stock exchange. Mendoza is a former Ashmore Group Plc (ASHM) executive. Nobody at Siesa was available to comment, an assistant said by phone. Edenor spokesman Alberto Lippi declined to comment.\nPrice Caps\nPresident Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who was re- elected to a second four-year term last year, has maintained electricity price caps first introduced during the country\u2019s 2002 financial crisis and continued by her late husband and predecessor, Nestor Kirchner . The rates freeze prompted Paris- based Electricite de France SA to agree in 2005 to sell Edenor to a Buenos Aires-based fund controlled by Argentine businessman Marcelo Mindlin, which later acquired electricity transmitter Transener and it was renamed as Pampa Energia SA.\nOn July 12, the government appointed an administrator at Empresa Distribuidora de Energia Sur SA, or Edesur, after the company missed a 150 million-peso payment to power wholesaler Cammesa. The price caps drove gas pipeline company Transportadora de Gas del Norte SA to halt payments on $22.1 million of debt in 2008 and natural gas distributor Metrogas SA (METR) to file for bankruptcy protection in 2010.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Pablo Gonzalez in Buenos Aires at pgonzalez49@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:34:15", "post_time": "2012-08-07 15:44:45", "author": "Pablo Gonzalez", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-07/argentina-s-edenor-said-to-negotiate-asset-sales.html", "title": "Argentina\u2019s Edenor Said to Negotiate Asset Sales", "post_date": "2012-08-07", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "MERVAL", "embers_id": "a789e6d8f65e670f7d14747e0f7d636a980abad1"}, {"content": "Tim Falls as Shareholder Alleges Earnings Fraud: Sao Paulo Mover\nBy Julia Leite - 2012-10-02T22:52:23Z\nTim Participacoes SA (TIMP3) dropped to a 19- month low after a minority shareholder said his complaint prompted Brazilian and U.S. regulators to investigate the telecommunications company\u2019s financial statements for fraud.\nTim, the Brazilian unit of Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) , slid 3.8 percent to 7.57 reais at the close of trading in Sao Paulo, the lowest since March 2011. It sank as much as 9.4 percent earlier in the day.\nMinority shareholder Nelson Tanure said he filed a complaint with regulators that alleges Tim bolstered reported profit by provisioning only 126 million reais ($62.2 million) for a potential tax delinquency of 6.6 billion reais. In a regulatory filing , Tim said it is aware of the complaint and that the allegations of fraud are false.\n\u201cThis procedure helped inflate the company\u2019s profits under the administration of Luca Luciani,\u201d Tanure said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cHad the company followed the conservative management practices of previous administrations, profits would have been half of what was reported in 2011.\u201d\nBrazil \u2019s regulator, known as the CVM, and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the U.S. are investigating the complaint of irregularities, according to Tanure\u2019s statement.\nEfforts to reach Luciani, Tim\u2019s former chief executive officer, weren\u2019t successful. He left the company and \u201cgave up all his mandates,\u201d Telecom Italia said in a May 5 statement. A Milan prosecutor filed a request in June to indict Telecom Italia and three former executives including Luciani in connection with SIM-card fraud at the domestic mobile phone unit, according to a court document.\nProvision Audit\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time there are rumors of problems in Tim\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d Marcelo Varejao, an analyst at brokerage Socopa Corretora, said by phone from Sao Paulo . \u201cIt\u2019s always worrisome. I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable as a shareholder with these rumors going around. But it needs to be investigated.\u201d\nJVCO, the investing group through which Tanure filed the complaint, said in a reply to e-mailed questions that it had notified Tim before contacting regulators, and that it asked for a specific audit on the provisions regarding tax issues, which it says were reduced during Luciani\u2019s management.\n\u201cTelecom Italia is acting with no concern for Tim\u2019s interests, going against Brazilian law and harming the company\u2019s reputation,\u201d JVCO said.\nTim said it hasn\u2019t been notified of any investigation by the SEC or the CVM.\n\u201cThe reports are completely untrue, wrong and misleading,\u201d Tim said in the regulatory filing. \u201cThe company is evaluating judicial measures to preserve its interests and the interests of its shareholders.\u201d\nNothing New\nPress officials at CVM and John Nester , an SEC spokesman, declined to comment.\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t new -- all these numbers were there before, they were public,\u201d said Roger Oey, the head of research at BES Securities do Brasil SA in Sao Paulo. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ve done the irregularities suggested.\u201d\nShares pared losses after Tim released its statement.\nTim shares have declined 18 percent this year, while the Bovespa gained 4.3 percent.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Julia Leite in New York at jleite3@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Papadopoulos at papadopoulos@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:34:33", "post_time": "2012-10-02 18:52:23", "author": "Julia Leite", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-02/tim-falls-as-shareholder-claims-earnings-fraud-sao-paulo-mover.html", "title": "Tim Falls as Shareholder Alleges Earnings Fraud: Sao Paulo Mover", "post_date": "2012-10-02", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "MERVAL", "embers_id": "8e3afe8e83c57b5460ab06369f5ab60c9b198d2b"}, {"content": "Nokia Dividend Elimination Looms as Cash Dwindles\nBy Adam Ewing - 2012-09-27T23:00:16Z\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story on the web mistakenly stated in the headline that Nokia had canceled its dividend. The company has not announced such a move, though investors and analysts expect it may happen.\nAs Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) depletes its cash pile amid a prolonged turnaround effort, investors are bracing for something that hasn\u2019t happened in decades: no dividends.\nThe unprofitable phonemaker is consuming about $300 million a month, and many investors and bondholders say the company risks running out of funds as it struggles to gain traction for its smartphones, which trail Apple Inc. (AAPL) \u2019s iPhone and devices using Google Inc. (GOOG) \u2019s Android.\n\u201cMost crucial for Nokia now is to turn around their sales and reach profitability as soon as possible,\u201d said Mikael Anttila, who helps manage corporate bonds, including Nokia debt, at SEB AB in Stockholm . \u201cUntil then, it would be rational for them to not pay dividends, to help maintain what cash they have.\u201d\nWithout a dividend, Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop risks alienating yield-focused investors at a time when Nokia\u2019s stock price is headed for its fifth consecutive annual decline.\nThe cash concerns underscore the depth of Nokia\u2019s crisis. The company has paid a dividend every year since at least 1989, which is as far back as its electronic records go. Even the breakup of the Soviet Union , a major buyer of Nokia\u2019s networking gear whose demise spelled financial tumult for the company more than 20 years ago, didn\u2019t prevent it from returning cash to investors.\nPaper Mill\nNokia, based in Espoo, Finland , will probably omit the payout for 2012 after slashing it by more than half over the past four years to 20 cents a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. To maintain the dividend at its current level, Nokia would have to pay about 750 million euros ($964 million) annually out of its dwindling bank account.\nDoug Dawson , a spokesman for Nokia, declined to comment on dividend plans. The phonemaker typically announces its annual payout when it reports fourth-quarter earnings in January.\nFounded in 1865 as a pulp and paper mill on the Nokia River, the company expanded into mobile phones in the 1980s and became Europe \u2019s most valuable corporation at the height of the technology boom. But Nokia was slow to adapt as touchscreen smartphones became the real drivers of the mobile handset market, and its stock has plunged about 90 percent since Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007.\nThe company has announced more than 20,000 job cuts, closed production and research facilities and sold patents and other assets in a bid to become profitable again.\nDwindling Cash\nNokia lost 2.34 billion euros in the first half and analysts estimate losses will continue at least six more quarters , the average projections compiled by Bloomberg show. Its net cash has shrunk by half in the past five years to 4.2 billion euros at the of June and will drop below 3 billion euros by year-end, Standard & Poor\u2019s predicts. Gross cash at the end of June was 9.4 billion euros.\nNokia also has debt of 5.2 billion euros and some repayments are looming. A 1.25 billion-euro bond matures in February 2014, and the company faces repayments in 2016, 2017 and 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A 1.5 billion-euro revolving credit facility could help Nokia shore up its cash reserves.\nThe cost of insuring Nokia bonds using credit-default swaps has almost tripled this year and reached a record of 1,240 basis points on July 18. It added 18 basis points, or 1.9 percent, to 950.58 basis points as of 4:48 p.m. Helsinki time, the biggest intraday jump in three weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nCredit-Default Swaps\nCredit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.\nWith Nokia\u2019s debt at junk status with the three main rating companies, it should already have suspended dividends, said Sami Sarkamies, a Nordea Bank AB analyst in Helsinki.\n\u201cIt was a mistake not to stop the dividend payment given the weakened outlook,\u201d he said. \u201cThis may cost shareholders dearly if Nokia for example needs to pull the plug early on its smartphone revamp due to not being able to afford the costs.\u201d\nNokia controlled more than half of global smartphone sales before the first iPhone and Android devices were introduced. Today Nokia\u2019s share in smartphones is about 6.6 percent, according to research firm IDC. IPhone and Android combined make up 85 percent of the market.\nIPhone Challenge\nNokia last year abandoned its home-grown operating system and began using the Windows operating system from Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , where CEO Elop used to work. On Sept. 5, Nokia introduced two new models that run Windows Phone 8, the newest version of the program that Nokia is betting on to lure customers away from Apple and Google. The phones will face off against the iPhone 5, which was unveiled on Sept. 12 and shattered the first-day sales of the previous version.\nNokia is set to start rolling out its new Lumia models, with Italian carriers and Sweden \u2019s largest operator among the first to disclose a debut for the devices. They will be offered in mid-November in Italy by Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) , Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , 3 Italia SpA and Wind Telecomunicazioni SpA. The Lumia 920 will be priced at 599 euros and the Lumia 820 at 499 euros in the country. TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) in Sweden will sell the device from Nov. 12.\nShares of Nokia added 2.6 percent to 2.05 euros at 4:58 p.m. in Helsinki. They have slumped more than 70 percent since February 2011, when the company said its phones would run Windows. The stock has fallen 46 percent this year, valuing Nokia at 7.67 billion euros.\n\u2018Limited Room\u2019\nThe new Windows software has yet to win over users and may not be the catalyst Nokia is expecting, Kai Korschelt, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in London , said in a Sept. 6 note. Apple and Google are likely to keep dominating smartphone sales, Korschelt wrote, with Android potentially gaining strength in the lower end of the handset market, which has long been Nokia\u2019s stronghold. That would leave \u201climited room\u201d for Windows handsets, Korschelt said.\nAnd with restructuring costs still to come this year and next, the company\u2019s free cash flow won\u2019t become positive until after 2014, Korschelt said.\nThe sputtering demand for Windows-based phones means Nokia \u201ccould well warn for the third quarter, or at least miss expectations,\u201d Pierre Ferragu , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. in London, said in a Sept. 14 note.\n\u2018Fallen Angel\u2019\nThe most likely outcome is Nokia facing three years of \u201cdifficult transition,\u201d serving a niche Windows Phone market and keeping a decent volume of business in low-end phones -- a scenario that would deplete most of its cash, Ferragu said.\nWith Nokia no longer the biggest handset maker, its primary challenge will be to get its debut and spending down to a level that\u2019s more appropriate for a company of its current size, said Arne Eidshagen, who helps manage about 350 million euros in high-yield debt, including Nokia\u2019s, at Alfred Berg Asset Management in Oslo.\n\u201cThe danger with a fallen angel like Nokia.\u201d Eidshagen said, \u201cis that they can\u2019t shrink the balance sheet to meet the new environment.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Adam Ewing in Stockholm at aewing5@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net\nNokia Dividend Elimination Looms as IPhone Chase Cuts Cash\nNokia\nThe new Nokia Lumia 820 smartphones.\nThe new Nokia Lumia 820 smartphones.

While the move would lessen the Milan-based company\u2019s control over one of its biggest assets, it could free up resources to reduce debt that is currently double its market value.\n\u201cFossati\u2019s public support shows there is increasing pressure to go ahead with this deal,\u201d said Robin Bienenstock , a London-based analyst for Sanford C Bernstein. \u201cIf Telecom Italia can get the state to invest through Cassa Depositi while keeping control of the network, that would be the best possible outcome.\u201d\nBernabe said last week there is an \u201copen dialogue\u201d with state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA about a possible investment in the network, adding that \u201cother investors such as infrastructure funds may be interested in this project.\u201d\nKeeping Control\nTelecom Italia hasn\u2019t specified other details of a potential spinoff yet, apart from saying that it wants to keep control of the network. In April, Bernabe said for the first time the company may consider separating its fixed-access network from its other business.\nThe operator\u2019s fixed-line access network may be valued at between 13 billion euros ($16.9 billion) and 15 billion euros, according to Fossati. Funds raised from the sale of a stake in the grid could be used to cut debt or increase investments, Fossati said.\nTelecom Italia forecasts adjusted net debt to fall to about 27.5 billion euros at the end of this year from 30.4 billion euros at the end of June.\nIn August, the company said first-half earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization declined 1.6 percent to 5.86 billion euros. Domestic fixed-line revenue dropped 2.9 percent to 6.47 billion euros and mobile sales in Italy fell 3.4 percent to 3.38 billion euros.\nState Investment\nTelecom Italia fell 2 percent to 79.7 euro cents in Milan trading today, valuing the company at 14.8 billion euros. The stock has dropped 4.1 percent this year, compared with a 1.5 percent decline of the 23-member Bloomberg Europe Telecommunications Services index.\nFossati said an investment by the state lender would underline the \u201cstrategic nature\u201d of the asset for the government. Bernabe has said that Telecom Italia would keep control of its access network, a condition also seen as \u201cessential\u201d to the plan by Fossati.\nSociete Generale SA analysts said in a July 30 note that Telecom Italia would probably only recapitalize the network through new investors and not sell it. A stumbling block could be a potential demand by the state to separate the network as an independent legal entity to allow competitors to take a stake, the analysts said, adding that such an approach would be harsher than previous cases of network separation in other European markets such as the U.K.\nInvestments Needed\nIn Britain, former monopoly BT Group (BT/A) established its Openreach unit in 2006, following an agreement with watchdog Ofcom to allow rivals to access its network. Other operators can buy services from BT on the same terms as the British company\u2019s own businesses and Openreach\u2019s engineering and systems capabilities are separate from the rest of the company.\nIn 2008, Telecom Italia created the Open Access division to manage the grid, bowing to regulatory pressure to improve access for competitors. Additional investors for Telecom Italia\u2019s network would help to speed up necessary upgrades and enable companies and consumers to benefit from new digital services to boost economic growth, Fossati said.\nCountries and companies are relying on fast broadband access to improve business processes, cut red tape and reduce spending as new applications such as remote health monitoring develop. Research cited by the European Commission indicates that a 10 percent increase in the broadband penetration might be able to boost gross domestic product by about 1 percent.\nFaster Networks\nThe biggest shareholder of Telecom Italia is holding company Telco SpA, through which Spain \u2019s Telefonica SA and partners Mediobanca SpA, Assicurazioni Generali SpA and Intesa Sanpaolo SpA own about 22.5 percent of the operator.\nFossati also said the roll-out of new and faster broadband services in Italy should be based on Telecom Italia\u2019s network.\nTelecom Italia this month signed a cooperation accord with Fastweb SpA, controlled by Swisscom AG (SCMN) , to share costs and investments in the construction of their high-speed next- generation networks.\nThe accord is open to other operators interested in co- investing in infrastructure based on the fiber-to-the-cabinet, or FTTCab, technology that runs cables to a street-level cabinet and then connects it to homes via copper wiring. Network company Metroweb SpA, whose investors include Cassa Depositi e Prestiti\u2019s Fondo Strategico, plans to roll out fiber in some Italian cities adopting the so-called fiber-to-the-home technology, which brings fiber directly to homes and offices.\n\u201cThere are no resources to waste, so rolling out two networks, it\u2019s not doable,\u201d Fossati said. \u201cAnd Telecom Italia\u2019s existing grid is the best starting point.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Chiara Remondini in Milan at cremondini@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net\nTelecom Italia Urged to Spin Off Network\nAlessia Pierdomenico/Bloomberg\nTelecom Italia SpA would gain much-needed funds to revive growth and cut debt by spinning off itsfixed-lined network, its second-biggest shareholder said.\nTelecom Italia SpA would gain much-needed funds to revive growth and cut debt by spinning off itsfixed-lined network, its second-biggest shareholder said.

The deadline for a first round of bids hasn\u2019t been set, the person said.\nDirecTV, the largest U.S. satellite-television provider, is counting on surging demand for pay-TV and Internet service in Latin America as growth subsides in its home market. The company lost clients for the first time last quarter in the U.S., while its Latin American customer base expanded 36 percent from a year earlier.\nDarris Gringeri, a spokesman for El Segundo, California- based DirecTV (DTV) , declined to comment, as did a Vivendi representative who asked not to be named under company policy.\nDirecTV\u2019s conversations with Vivendi are still at an early stage and may not lead to a bid, said one of the people familiar with the matter.\nVivendi rose as much as 3 percent to 15.70 euros and traded 2.1 percent higher as of 9:53 a.m. in Paris. DirecTV fell 1.4 percent to $53.44 in New York yesterday.\nVivendi hired Rothschild and Deutsche Bank AG to study options for GVT including a sale or an initial public offering, people familiar with the situation said last month.\nBrazil Internet\nDirecTV, which trails only billionaire Carlos Slim \u2019s America Movil SAB in Latin American TV subscribers, began offering high-speed Internet access last year in Brazil over a wireless network. The company acquired rights to regional airwaves for Internet services in a June government auction.\nGVT, which Vivendi agreed in 2009 to acquire for $4.18 billion after trumping a bid from Madrid-based Telefonica SA (TEF) , has helped expand the Paris-based media company\u2019s revenue and may be worth 5.2 billion euros ($6.4 billion), according to estimates in April by Morgan Stanley.\nVivendi Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou is analyzing an overhaul of the company\u2019s structure after the stock fell to a nine-year low in April. Moody\u2019s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings have said that Vivendi\u2019s debt rating may be cut unless it reduces liabilities.\nFourtou assumed responsibility for strategy since Chief Executive Officer Jean-Bernard Levy was ousted in June. The Vivendi chairman is evaluating whether to reduce the emphasis of the group\u2019s telecommunications businesses, which he believes lack scale and require too much investment, people familiar with the matter said in June.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Serena Saitto in New York at ssaitto@bloomberg.net ; Matthew Campbell in London at mcampbell39@bloomberg.net ; Alex Sherman in New York at asherman6@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jeffrey McCracken at jmccracken3@bloomberg.net ; Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net\nDirecTV Said to Contemplate Bid for GVT\nPaul Taggart/Bloomberg\nDirecTV, the largest U.S. satellite-television provider, is counting on surging demand for pay-TV and Internet service in Latin America as growth subsides in its home market.\nDirecTV, the largest U.S. satellite-television provider, is counting on surging demand for pay-TV and Internet service in Latin America as growth subsides in its home market.

(AAPL) \u2019s iPhone 5 in the U.K. and Germany, handing Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) the chance to win over customers.\nThe iPhone 5, unveiled yesterday, will connect to fourth- generation wireless networks in Europe that run on a 1,800 MHz band. Deutsche Telekom is currently rolling out such a network in German cities, while its British venture with France Telecom SA (FTE) , called EE, plans to deploy the service to more than a third of the U.K. population by the end of the year.\nOther European operators, including Vodafone, Telefonica\u2019s O2 business and Vivendi SA\u2019s SFR unit, will only be able to offer the iPhone 5 on the current slower 3G network.

EE, the largest mobile-phone operator in the U.K., said this week that the new service is five times faster than is currently available.\nDeutsche Telekom rose 0.3 percent to 9.74 euros in Frankfurt as of 2:12 p.m. while Vodafone gained 1.6 percent to 176.70 pence in London , Telefoncia dropped 0.9 percent to 11.32 euros in Madrid and France Telecom fell 1.8 percent to 10.59 euros in Paris.\nVodafone has opposed EE\u2019s move to start 4G services in the U.K. ahead of an upcoming auction of frequencies, saying it was \u201cfrankly shocked\u201d by local regulator Ofcom\u2019s approval of the service. The decision created a \u201ccompetitive distortion,\u201d Vodafone said in August.\nApple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook took the stage in San Francisco yesterday to tout iPhone 5, which boasts a bigger screen and has a chip that handles tasks more quickly than past versions. Apple is betting that the device is loaded with enough features to set it apart in a market swiftly crowding with phones by Nokia Oyj, Microsoft Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co.\nHead Start\nIn Germany, Vodafone and O2 offer devices from Samsung, LG Electronics Inc. and HTC Corp. that run on their local 4G networks.\nApple\u2019s decision to restrict the compatibility of the iPhone 5 with certain European LTE networks allows Deutsche Telekom to get a head start in the battle for customers that want faster internet access, just as Germany\u2019s former state monopoly begins to deploy 4G services in cities after starting in rural areas.\nCarl Howe , an analyst at Boston-based Yankee Group , is predicting that Apple will sell more than 10 million of the new handset by month\u2019s end, surpassing the record set last year by the predecessor device, the iPhone 4S.\nGetting Lucky\nApple doesn\u2019t prefer one operator over another, said Markus Goebel , a spokesman for O2 Germany in Munich. \u201cApple wants to maximize LTE reach for its iPhone and Deutsche Telekom got lucky that the 1,800 MHz frequency is also used by operators in Asia,\u201d he said.\nO2 and Vodafone will still offer the iPhone 5 on their current 3G networks, according to Goebel and Vodafone Germany spokesman Kuzey Esener.\nVodafone\u2019s Italian unit, which is deploying equipment needed for a faster network on its existing airwaves, will be able to offer 4G services \u201cquite quickly,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts including Nick Delfas said today in a note. A Vodafone spokesman declined to comment.\nThe iPhone 5 will be available for orders on Sept. 14 and lands on store shelves Sept. 21 in the U.S., Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong , Japan, Singapore and the U.K. It goes on sale in another 22 countries on Sept. 28.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Joseph de Weck in Frankfurt at jdeweck@bloomberg.net ; Jonathan Browning in London at jbrowning9@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:34:59", "post_time": "2012-09-13 08:16:55", "author": "Joseph de Weck , Jonathan Browning", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-13/vodafone-telefonica-miss-out-on-fast-version-of-iphone-5.html", "title": "Vodafone, Telefonica Miss Out on Fast Version of IPhone 5", "post_date": "2012-09-13", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "MERVAL", "embers_id": "694b1050f5b2b3120d6f11c4f5eec7adceef0c25"}], "CHILE65": [{"content": "Water Utilities Should Change Pricing to Curb Use, Oracle Says\nBy Sally Bakewell - 2012-10-22T15:05:12Z\nWater utilities should adopt pricing structures that encourage consumers to curb water use in order to meet demand that industry leaders say may outstrip supply by 2030, according to a survey by Oracle Corp.

Both companies on Oct. 20 denied they planned to combine operations.\nSuez Chief Executive Officer Jean-Louis Chaussade contacted Veolia\u2019s Antoine Frerot in August to propose a merger, Le Monde reported that day. Discussions were called off following meetings the next month involving Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Rothschild, the newspaper reported.\nVeolia fell 4.4 percent to 8.136 euros by 2:45 p.m. in Paris while Suez dropped 1.1 percent to 8.343 euros. Veolia\u2019s market value has slumped more than half since the middle of 2011 when it began to accelerate a reorganization and asset sales. Veolia and Suez are both valued at about 4.3 billion euros ($5.6 billion).\nThe companies have a combined 55 percent of the French drinking-water market by population and 42 percent of the water treatment business, according to a 2012 report by the FP2E trade association, posing antitrust hurdles to any possible merger.\n\u201cThere is no chance that they will be allowed to merge to create a super water player,\u201d Dimitra Christakou, a water analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said by e-mail. \u201cBetween them they own probably over 50 percent of the global utilities market.\u201d\nDrinking-Water Market\nAbout 70 percent of France \u2019s drinking water market is in non-state hands and 56 percent of the water-treatment business.\nThe companies\u2019 industrial waste businesses are vulnerable to economic weakness as factories cut output.

The slow economy would make disposals more difficult and a combination between the utilities \u201cunworkable.\u201d\nSuez Environnement Chief Financial Officer Jean-Marc Boursier is scheduled to comment on third-quarter earnings on Oct. 25 while Veolia will publish results on Nov. 7.

Nuclear energy provides more than three quarters of French power production and helps keep the country\u2019s electricity prices among the lowest in Europe.\n\u201cNuclear energy is clearly less expensive for us,\u201d Cie. de Saint Gobain (SGO) Chief Executive Officer Pierre-Andre de Chalendar said in November.\nEnergy Minister Delphine Batho defended the government\u2019s plan at the conference yesterday, saying, \u201cwe will lower the proportion of nuclear in electricity production. We won\u2019t get out of nuclear because we will need it for a long time but at the same time we need to diversify our sources. We can keep nuclear jobs and add jobs in solar and wind.\u201d\nFinance Minister Pierre Moscovici and Labor Minister Michel Sapin also sought to reassure businesses.\n\u2018Quicker, Simpler\u2019\n\u201cCompetitiveness isn\u2019t a dirty word,\u201d Moscovici said as he pledged to set up a framework favorable to investment and innovation. \u201cGovernment services must also work in a quicker and simpler way.\u201d\nHe said the 2013 budget to be presented in the week of Sept. 24 will have measures for companies. He also said social spending can\u2019t be covered entirely by payroll taxes, promising to address the issue next year.\nFrance needs rules that \u201callow companies to adapt,\u201d Sapin said in a Bloomberg TV interview, adding that he\u2019s discussing adaptability with companies. It\u2019s about the \u201cability of companies to adapt to a changing world, changing technology and economic shocks.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Francois de Beaupuy in Paris at fdebeaupuy@bloomberg.net ; Tara Patel in Paris at tpatel2@bloomberg.net ; Mark Deen in Paris at markdeen@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Vidya Root at vroot@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:50:26", "post_time": "2012-08-31 08:28:10", "author": "Francois de Beaupuy, Tara Patel , Mark Deen", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-30/hollande-s-business-policies-slammed-by-french-corporate-leaders.html", "title": "Hollande Business Policies Faulted by French Executives", "post_date": "2012-08-31", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "CHILE65", "embers_id": "5fc5d29d0fb33e2b7c170bb37cddd5bc6b5591f6"}, {"content": "Suez Environnement Takes Additional Measures to Protect Profits\nBy Tara Patel and Francine Lacqua - 2012-08-30T15:42:54Z\nSuez Environnement, Europe\u2019s second- biggest water company, is cutting costs and investment after its waste-handling business was hurt by the slowing economy.\n\u201cWe have decided to take additional measures in order to protect our profits in the best way we can,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Jean-Louis Chaussade said today in an interview on Bloomberg Television. These include \u201cslowly\u201d reducing investment and additional cost-cutting steps, he said.\nChaussade joined other executives from some of France \u2019s biggest companies, gathered for an annual conference organized by the employers\u2019 group Medef outside Paris, in calling for policies to spur growth. Suez Environnment, which is 36 percent owned by GDF Suez (GSZ) SA, reported an 82 percent slump in first-half profit as the volume of waste handled dropped in response to lower factory output.\n\u201cThere is a direct relation between waste volumes and industrial activity,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cWe need to get back industrial growth.\u201d\nSuez Environnement said earlier this month it would raise a cost-savings target by 40 million euros ($50 million) this year to 150 million euros and reduce net investment by 100 million euros. Some smaller assets may be sold, the company said.\nVisibility is \u201cvery difficult\u201d for the next year given slowing economic growth in Europe , the U.S. and China , Chaussade said in today\u2019s interview.\nNo Difficulties\nThe utility\u2019s biggest market after France is Spain, which is considering a second European bailout amid a recession and an unemployment rate of about 25 percent.\nEven so, Suez Environnement hasn\u2019t faced any difficulties in getting Spaniards to pay their water bills.\n\u201cWe do not see for the time being any difficulties with payments,\u201d Chaussade said. \u201cSpain is reacting to its difficulties by asking private companies to take care of more networks and users. There are opportunities.\u201d\nSpanish water prices are \u201cwell below\u201d the European average while investment is needed in infrastructure, according to the French utility, which controls Spain \u2019s largest non-state water supplier Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona SA, or Agbar.\nTo help low-income households, Suez Environnement has reduced rates, according to Chaussade.\nThe French government will unveil a proposed law as early as next week for so-called social tariffs for water, power and natural gas, Environment and Energy Minister Delphine Batho said yesterday. Under the plan, rates would rise depending on volumes consumed.\n\u201cWe are promoters of social tariffs,\u201d Chaussade said in the interview. \u201cWe are convinced that it is a solution that is needed in France. But if there are lower rates for the first cubic meters of water for the most vulnerable people then you have to get this back on other clients.\u201d\nThe shares fell 3.1 percent to 8.778 euros as of the close of trading in Paris.

Many investors are waiting for the market to bottom before buying, it said. As prices decline, steel producers in China may switch to imports from lower-quality and more expensive domestic ore, which will support the market in the first quarter, the bank said.\nChina\u2019s iron-ore imports fell 0.8 percent to 57.87 million tons last month, the lowest since April, according to customs. Steel-product exports were 4.32 million tons in July, 17 percent lower than a month earlier.\nShares in Rio de Janeiro-based Vale, the top iron-ore producer, dropped 3.2 percent to 34.19 reais yesterday, the lowest since Sept. 11, 2009.

(BHP) , the world\u2019s largest mining company, this week reported a 35 percent drop in earnings to $15.4 billion in the year ended June 30 because of falling commodity prices.

Iron ore inventories at ports have gained 3 percent since March, according to Shanghai Steelhome Information.\nA preliminary reading of 47.8 for the purchasing managers\u2019 index released by HSBC and Markit Economics compares with July\u2019s final 49.3 figure. If confirmed, it would be the lowest level since November and the 10th month that the reading has been below 50, the longest run in the index\u2019s eight-year history.\nGross domestic product increased 7.6 percent from a year earlier in the second quarter, the least since the first quarter of 2009, official figures show, while export growth collapsed in July and industrial output fell short of projections, reports this month showed. The economy may expand 8.1 percent this year, the slowest pace in four years, according to the median of a Bloomberg survey of 44 economists.\nIron ore is measured in dry tons, or metric tons less moisture.

BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world\u2019s biggest money manager, this month outlaid about A$94 million to lift its Fortescue stake. The steelmaking raw material is forecast to gain 18 percent by the second quarter next year, data from three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg shows.\nNew iron ore mines and expansions are being delayed by rising costs at the same time as data yesterday showed imports by China, the world\u2019s biggest steelmaker, rose to a record. The data came the same month a survey modeled on the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s Beige Book showed China\u2019s economy is in better shape than official statistics suggest.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just Fortescue, there are other iron ore companies all over the world that are offering great value,\u201d Evy Hambro , portfolio manager of BlackRock Inc.\u2019s $11 billion World Mining Fund in London, said by phone. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a very clear signal sent to the market by Andrew Forrest that he\u2019s putting his money where his mouth is in terms of increasing his holding.\u201d\nIron ore companies in the Bloomberg Industries Global Iron Ore Mining Index (BWMING) are trading at 5.6 times earnings. The last time the index ratio fell below 6 times earnings was in January 2009. Iron ore companies underperformed the price of the raw material by about 8 percent in the second quarter, according to Bloomberg Industries.\nChina Concerns\n\u201cThe whole resource sector has dropped as a consequence of concern about China\u2019s growth profiles and Europe and that provides opportunities for those that are more focused on individual propositions to invest and make good returns,\u201d John Robinson , Melbourne-based chairman of Global Mining Investment Ltd., said by phone. His fund owns shares in Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Fortescue and Atlas Iron Ltd. (AGO) , and has been boosting its iron-ore position in the past year. The fund is overseen by BlackRock.\nLondon\u2019s Ferrexpo Plc (FXPO) as well as Arrium Ltd., the Sydney- based steel and iron-ore producer that changed its name from OneSteel this month, and Cleveland, Ohio\u2019s Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF) have the lowest forecast price to earnings ratio of producers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nAtlas Iron\nBlackRock Fund Advisors on July 6 disclosed the purchase of 19.2 million shares in Fortescue, taking its stake to about 2 percent. BNP Paribas SA bought 2.3 million Ferrexpo shares on April 30 and Schroder Investment Management Ltd. bought 14.1 million shares in Atlas Iron on May 31, increasing its stake to 8.58 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nFortescue rose 1.7 percent to A$4.92 at the close of trading in Sydney, while the key S&P/ASX 200 Index ended little changed. Arrium was unchanged. Ferrexpo gained 5.5 percent in London trading yesterday.\nSchroder declined to comment on the purchase when contacted by e-mail, citing a global policy not to comment on stocks. Anita Poppi, a Sydney-based spokeswoman for BNP Paribas, wasn\u2019t immediately able to comment.\nProject delays and rising costs are crimping new supply are helping push prices higher, while China\u2019s domestic iron-ore producers struggle to turn a profit, said Justin Smirk, a Sydney-based commodity analyst with Westpac Banking Corp.\n\u2018Getting Suspicious\u2019\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting increasingly suspicious of estimates of large supply responses,\u201d he said by phone. He\u2019s forecasting iron ore to trade at $185 a metric ton by the third quarter of next year from $135.50 a ton currently. \u201cChina\u2019s ability to raise domestic iron-ore production profitably is being hampered by rising costs.\u201d\nChina\u2019s iron ore imports in the first six months this year gained 9.7 percent from a year earlier to a record 366.2 million tons, General Customs data showed yesterday. The previous record was set in the second half of 2011.\nDelayed projects include Anglo American Plc (AAL) \u2019s Minas Rio in Brazil, which was originally slated to open in 2009, and Simandou in Guinea, which Rio Tinto anticipates will start in 2015 rather than next year, as previously forecast.\nVale (VALE) SA, the world\u2019s largest producer, delayed an $8 billion expansion of the Serra Sul project last year because of permitting issues, higher costs and labor shortages. Hancock Prospecting Pty, controlled by Asia\u2019s richest woman Gina Rinehart, said last month it will delay the Roy Hill project because of a legal challenge.\nWealth Rankings\nRinehart is ranked as the 29th wealthiest person in the world with a net worth of $18.7 billion, according to the daily Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Forrest\u2019s net worth is estimated at $5.2 billion, according to data compiled and calculated by Bloomberg, ranking him second behind Rinehart in Australia.\nFortescue spokeswoman Yvonne Ball declined to comment on Forrest\u2019s purchases when contacted by phone.\nThe China Beige Book, through interviews of about 2,000 company executives and bankers from May 14 to June 8, found manufacturing and retail sales strengthened, in contrast with official data that showed the weakest non-holiday sales growth since 2006 in May.\nThe survey by CBB International LLC suggests China\u2019s measures to reverse the deepest slowdown since 2008 may be boosting growth even as Europe\u2019s sovereign debt crisis crimps exports.\nMore Stimulus\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen lower rates out of China and we expect there\u2019d be additional fiscal stimulus,\u201d Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion at Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne, said in a telephone interview.\nThe data contrast with another private survey watched by investors, the manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index released monthly by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. That gauge fell in June to the lowest level since November, showing a contraction for an eighth straight month. The survey covers executives at more than 400 companies.\nCustoms data yesterday also showed China\u2019s total imports rose less than anticipated in June as export growth slowed, adding pressure on the government to support demand.\nThe weaker data may lead to more stimulus measures that would benefit raw material suppliers, underpinning demand for their products as China\u2019s new government seeks to boost the economy during the second half of the year, said Schroeders.\nChina Urbanization\n\u201cA lot of people are arguing we\u2019re currently seeing the peak in growth in Chinese steel demand,\u201d Westpac\u2019s Smirk said. \u201cWe disagree, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to occur until 2015-16.\u201d\nRio Tinto (RIO) , the second-largest shipper of iron ore, expects China to boost steel output by 43 percent to 1 billion tons by 2013 as it continues to urbanize. Global steel demand will probably increase 3.6 percent this year, from 5.6 percent in 2011, the World Steel Association said in April.\nThe London-based company sees the nation\u2019s growth accelerating in the second half and is tipping annual growth of 8 percent, beating China\u2019s target of 7.5 percent.\nVale is the cheapest of the three biggest exporters and may have a price to earnings ratio of 5.6 times next year, compared with its current ratio of 5.8 times. The ratio for Rio is estimated to decline to 6 from 7 times and BHP\u2019s ratio will be 8.9 from 9.6 times.\n\u201cA doomsday scenario where prices collapse to sub-$100 a ton in the next six months looks unlikely,\u201d said Pengana\u2019s Schroeders. He\u2019s bought Rio Tinto, BHP and Fortescue shares in the past two months. \u201cUnder that scenario the companies look relatively cheap.\u201d\nBuy Ratings\nRio has 28 buy ratings, representing 88 percent of ratings, the most of the iron ore producers considered, followed by India\u2019s Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA) and Fortescue with 20 buy ratings each, or 50 percent of ratings and 95 percent respectively. South Africa\u2019s Assore Ltd. (ASR) has the lowest with 2 ratings and then Kumba Iron Ore Ltd., controlled by London-based Anglo American, both representing one third of analysts.\nBrazil\u2019s MMX Mineracao (MMXM3) , India\u2019s NMDC Ltd (NMDC) and Cap SA (CAP) , Chile\u2019s biggest steel and iron-ore producer, are forecast to be the three most expensive of the companies compiled by Bloomberg.\nChinese Premier Wen Jiabao said downward pressure on the economy is still \u201crelatively large\u201d and the government will intensify fine-tuning of policies, the official Xinhua News Agency reported July 8. Asia\u2019s largest economy probably grew at the slowest pace in three years in the second quarter.\nThere are now signs that growth may steady after leaders stepped up stimulus to counter a slowdown and new home prices rose for the first time in 10 months in June.\n\u201cThe Chinese are working very hard to restore growth in the economy,\u201d said GMI\u2019s Robinson. \u201cThe graduated response they\u2019re showing at the moment is welcome and a good sign for the resource sector.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Elisabeth Behrmann in Sydney at ebehrmann1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rebecca Keenan at rkeenan5@bloomberg.net\nFortescue Metals Group Ltd.

That compares with $140 estimated by the Canberra- based bureau in March and an average of $153 last year. Shipments from the country may total 479 million tons, down from the 493 million tons predicted in March, it said.\nPrices dropped 2.2 percent this year as the Chinese economy expands at the slowest pace since 2009 and Europe \u2019s debt crisis threatens global growth. BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the top miner, said June 6 the debt crisis and spreading economic uncertainty will affect demand for commodities in the short term. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lakshmi Mittal of ArcelorMittal (MT) , the largest steelmaker, said June 19 demand for steel won\u2019t recover soon to levels before the financial crisis.\n\u201cThere has been a slowdown and prices have come back with that change in momentum,\u201d said David Lennox , a resource analyst at Fat Prophets in Sydney. \u201cThe outlook for China is slowing but they still do require significant iron ore.\u201d\nChina may expand 8.2 percent in 2012, compared with 9.2 percent last year, according to the median forecast of 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg this month. The nation\u2019s gross domestic product growth slowed for a fifth quarter to 8.1 percent in the first three months, government data showed.\nImport Demand\nThe forecast for lower prices stems from increasing supply from Australia and Brazil and moderating growth in imports, the report said. China\u2019s steel consumption may total 648 million tons this year, from 657 million tons forecast in March, because of the slowing economy, the bureau said.\nHSBC Holdings Plc lowered this week its growth estimate for China this year to 8.4 percent from 8.6 percent. That followed a cut by Citigroup Inc., which expects expansion of 7.8 percent, reflecting \u201canemic\u201d domestic activity in the second quarter and a further weakening of European demand. Daiwa Securities Group Inc. puts growth at 8.3 percent.\nThe world\u2019s second-biggest economy signaled a more- aggressive approach to sustaining expansion last month when Premier Wen Jiabao called for more efforts toward stabilizing growth. The central bank cut interest rates on June 7 for the first time since 2008 and the economic planning agency is stepping up approvals of investment projects.\nShort-Term Outlook\n\u201cRecent data that indicate a lower-than-expected rate of growth in China are key concerns for the short-term outlook,\u201d the bureau said today. China\u2019s economic growth may be 7.9 percent in 2012 from 8.2 percent estimated in March, it said.\nChinese manufacturing may shrink for an eighth month in June, according to data from HSBC and Markit Economics, and home values dropped in a record number of cities during May.\nImports of iron ore by China will grow 8 percent this year, slowing from 10 percent in 2011, according to London-based Clarkson Plc, the world\u2019s biggest shipbroker. Shipments totaled 63.8 million tons in May, the first increase in three months, customs data show. The country\u2019s mills produced 61.2 million tons of steel last month, 1.1 percent more than in April, according to the World Steel Association.\nSteel output this year in China, which produces almost half of the world\u2019s total, will be 700 million tons, the China Iron and Steel Association said June 16. That would be a 2.5 percent increase from 2011, the smallest annual rise since 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News using figures from the steel association.\nPrices of hot-rolled coil, a benchmark product, have fallen for 10 weeks to 4,146 yuan as of yesterday, according to researcher Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.\nThe bureau\u2019s forecast referred to iron ore with 62 percent content free-on-board Australia.

With shipping company Cia. Sud Americana de Vapores SA, it may have lost its way.\nQuinenco SA (QUINENC) , the Santiago-based holding company controlled by the Luksic brothers, said Sept. 2 it would buy as much as $1 billion of a $1.2 billion share increase in CSAV, Latin America \u2019s largest container shipping company. That will probably give the Luksics control after shareholders approved the transaction today. Since the announcement, shares in CSAV, as the company is called, have slumped 45 percent.\nGuillermo Luksic, who became chairman of CSAV after Quinenco bought 10 percent of the company from Chile\u2019s Claro family in March, is following billionaire U.S. financier Wilbur Ross in making a contrarian bet on the slumping shipping market.\nWith world stock markets and global growth both slowing, it will take a \u201cvery long time\u201d for the purchase to pay off, if ever, said Jorge Rios, an analyst for Santiago-based Corpbanca, Chile \u2019s fourth-largest bank by market value.\n\u201cThis company is generating value destruction,\u201d said Rios in a telephone interview. \u201cThere is no way the stock is going up in the short term.\u201d Rios has a \u201chold\u201d rating on the shares and said he will change that to \u201csell\u201d within a month.\nValparaiso, Chile-based CSAV lost $525 million in the first half of this year on the slowing global economy, rising fuel costs and a worldwide glut of vessels, after earning $171 million in 2010. Third-quarter losses will be close to the $339 million posted in the second quarter before a recovery begins in 2012, the company said in a statement on Sept. 26.\n\u2018Vital\u2019 Volatility Reduction\nThe stock has dropped more than 80 percent from its 12- month high on Oct. 28, 2010. The shares slid 3.8 percent to 120.99 pesos in Santiago trading today, while Chile\u2019s main stock index advanced 2.6 percent. Quinenco, which has fallen 34 percent this year, rose 2.5 percent to 1,130 pesos today.\nCSAV said today that it needs to take risks by expanding amid prospects of a recovery in the global shipping industry.\nWhile the company\u2019s results this year will be \u201cvery negative\u201d and a slump in developed economies signals tough times ahead, the industry has an \u201cattractive\u201d longer-term outlook, Oscar Hasbun, head of container shipping at the company, told shareholders in Valparaiso today. Losses will continue into the first half of next year, he said.\n\u2018Difficult Moment\u2019\n\u201cIt\u2019s an attractive industry passing through a difficult moment,\u201d Guillermo Luksic said today at the same meeting. \u201cNinety percent of the world\u2019s commerce moves around in boats.\u201d\nCSAV didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment about the share purchase. It did say the capital increase \u201cis vital to reduce the volatility of the results and improve the competitiveness of CSAV, since only by increasing the proportion of owned fleet the company may be in levels more suitable with the industry,\u201d in a regulatory filing on Sept. 2.\nCSAV said it will seek to take on a larger industry partner and plans to spin off Sudamericana Agencias & Maritimas SA, or SAAM, its port logistics business. The unit needs capital to expand, Hasbun said today.\nLuksic was unavailable for comment, according to Maria Teresa Soza of b2o, a Santiago-based PR firm that handles Quinenco\u2019s affairs.\nFamily Fortune\nThe Luksic patriarch, Andronico, who died in 2005, built the family fortune by purchasing a century-old, money-losing railroad operator in the Atacama Desert in 1980 and turning it into London-based copper miner Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , which last year had $4.58 billion in revenue. Guillermo and his brothers Jean- Paul and Andronico have since expanded the family business into other areas of Chile\u2019s economy.\nIn 2001, the family boosted its stake in Banco de Chile to 52.7 percent from 12 percent. The bank\u2019s market value has risen tenfold since the acquisition to about $9.5 billion from $992 million at the end of 2001, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Citigroup Inc. joined as a partner in 2008 and boosted its share of the Banco de Chile holding company, LQ Inversiones Financieras SA, to 50 percent in March, 2010.\nQuinenco also runs Cia. Cervecerias Unidas SA, the country\u2019s largest brewer and the second-biggest in Argentina , with Heineken NV. Annual revenue grew to $1.79 billion in 2010 from $1.12 billion in 2006, according to a company presentation prepared for investors.\nNegotiating Skills\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t among the most efficient in each industry where they participate, but they know how to negotiate good relationships,\u201d said Patricia Pellegrini, a Santiago-based analyst at Chilean brokerage LarrainVial SA.\nThe container-shipping industry, which had about $200 billion in revenue last year, is expected to lose between $2.5 billion and $3 billion in 2011, Philip Damas , director of liner shipping and supply chains for London-based Drewy Shipping Consultants Ltd, said in an interview in August.\n\u201cThe industry as a whole burned cash in the second quarter,\u201d said Menno Sanderse, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in London , in a Sept. 27 telephone interview. \u201cThings are not getting better, they are getting worse.\u201d\nCSAV, including its Norasia CSAV subsidiary, is the world\u2019s eighth-largest operator of container ships , according to Containerisation International, a London-based provider of data and analysis.\nCompany History\nFounded in 1872, CSAV\u2019s fleet expanded from 97 ships at the end of 2009 to as many as 147 by the third quarter of 2010, according to Clarkson Research Services Ltd., a unit of the world\u2019s largest shipbroker.\nThe container-shipping market is fragmented beyond the industry leaders, Denmark \u2019s A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S and Switzerland \u2019s Mediterranean Shipping Co., which use large, fuel- efficient vessels, said Diego Ocampo, a Buenos Aires-based analyst at Standard & Poor\u2019s . He cut CSAV\u2019s credit rating to B- from B, below investment grade, on Sept. 29.\nSmaller competitors such as CSAV may have to lay up their smaller, higher-cost vessels, according to Oslo-based investment bank RS Platou Markets AS on Sept. 27.\nQuinenco bought its initial 10 percent stake in CSAV from Maritima de Inversiones SA, which is owned by Chile\u2019s Claro family. Grupo Luksic, controlled by brothers Guillermo, Andronico and Jean-Paul, bought an additional 8 percent from the Claros on April 6.\n\u201cThey never thought that this year would be so bad,\u201d Pellegrini said. She told clients to sell CSAV stock after the company lowered its outlook for the rest of the year in its second-half earnings statement Sept. 26.\nFinancial Strength\nThe family has the financial wherewithal to ride out a long shipping slump. Iris Fontbona, the widow of mining magnate Andronico Luksic, heads the clan, which boasts a net worth of $19.2 billion, according to Forbes Magazine this year.\nThe Luksics aren\u2019t the only billionaires to seek opportunities in shipping in 2011. Ross, chairman of private- equity firm WL Ross & Co. in New York , is part of a group of investors that bought 30 ships hauling gasoline, diesel and other refined products for about $900 million on Sept. 27.\nThe industry is \u201crelatively close\u201d to the bottom of its business cycle, Ross told the Bloomberg Link\u2019s Dealmakers Summit on Sept. 27.\nCSAV investors must hope he\u2019s right.\n\u201cThe question is how much cash will you burn between now and when assets become expensive again,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s Sanderse said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have endless time unless you have bottomless pockets.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Matthew Craze in Santiago at mcraze@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Dale Crofts at dcrofts@bloomberg.net .\nWilbur Ross\nScott Eells/Bloomberg\nGuillermo Luksic, who became chairman of CSAV after Quinenco bought 10 percent of the company from Chile\u2019s Claro family in March, is following billionaire U.S. financier Wilbur Ross, shown, in making a contrarian bet on the slumping shipping market.\nGuillermo Luksic, who became chairman of CSAV after Quinenco bought 10 percent of the company from Chile\u2019s Claro family in March, is following billionaire U.S. financier Wilbur Ross, shown, in making a contrarian bet on the slumping shipping market.

(BHP) and Anglo American Plc spend as much as $100 billion on copper and other mining projects in Chile.\nThe country, struck by a power blackout as recently as this week, needs to boost capacity by 47 percent within 8 years to keep pace with consumption. Protesters from fishermen to university students oppose the plants, prompting miners to consider their own projects to help meet China\u2019s copper demand.\n\u201cChile will have to shelve many of the country\u2019s mining investments due to the high cost and scarcity of electricity,\u201d Joaquin Villarino, president of mining lobby group Consejo Minero , said in Santiago on April 19. Delays will jeopardize a \u201csignificant\u201d part of the proposed mine investments, he said.\nBHP Billiton , the world\u2019s largest mining company, may solicit offers to build a power station in northern Chile, Peter Beaven, head of the Melbourne-based company\u2019s base metals unit, said April 10. Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) is considering options for the location and providers of a power station in the Atacama Desert to supply its Quebrada Blanca mine, the company based in Vancouver said in an e-mailed response to questions.\nChile needs to add 8,000 megawatts to its 17,000-megawatt power system by 2020, according to National Energy Commission estimates. The mining industry accounts for about a fifth of the country\u2019s energy demands.\nEarthquake\nTransmission lines damaged by an 8.8-magnitude earthquake on Feb. 27, 2010 also need investment. The grid will be prone to blackouts for years to come, Chile\u2019s former energy minister Rodrigo Alvarez said Feb. 17. The latest blackout struck this week as supply was cut from the capital Santiago to the southern region of Los Lagos on April 23.\nPower prices on Chile \u2019s central grid rose from about $100 a megawatt hour at the start of 2010 to more than $150 a megawatt hour at the end of 2011, according to the Energy Ministry.\n\u201cIt is a challenge that the government is well aware of the need to ensure that economic growth is not constrained by a lack of power,\u201d John MacKenzie , head of Anglo\u2019s copper business, said in an April 10 interview in the Chilean capital.\nAlvarez resigned after a conflict related to fuel subsidies in the southern region of Aysen. President Sebastian Pinera then appointed Jorge Bunster on April 3 as his fifth energy minister in two years.\nEnvironmental Opposition\nOpposition from environmentalists and community groups are slowing construction of power projects, including HidroAysen in Patagonia that would become the country\u2019s biggest power generator, according to Villarino.\nHidroAysen , which is being developed by Colbun SA (COLBUN) and Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA , would generate 2,750 megawatts for Chile\u2019s central grid. State-owned Codelco, the world\u2019s largest copper producer, operates three mines in that region of the country. Last year\u2019s approval of the project sparked protests that led to hundreds of arrests and millions of dollars in damage in public infrastructure.\nHidroAysen still requires approval to build a 1,900- kilometer (1,180-mile) transmission line.\nMPX Energia SA (MPXE3) , controlled by Batista, faces delays to its Castilla project after fishermen won an injunction to halt its development. The plant will provide power to new mines proposed by Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and Teck.\n\u201cIf Castilla doesn\u2019t get approved then these projects will get delayed,\u201d Pedro Litsek, who heads MPX\u2019s Chilean operations, said in an interview in Santiago today.\nGDF Suez\nIn 2010 Pinera asked GDF Suez SA (GSZ) , Europe \u2019s largest natural- gas network operator, to scrap plans to build a 540-megawatt coal-fired power plant on the coastal site of Barrancones after environmental opposition.\nXstrata Plc (XTA) has partnered with Australia \u2019s Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG) to develop its Energia Austral hydroelectric project in southern Chile.\n\u201cEnergy risk is significant and we need to ensure that the risks are properly mitigated,\u201d Charlie Sartain , the head of Xstrata\u2019s copper business, said in an April 17 interview.\nLiquefied natural gas imports can be increased to Chile through the two LNG terminals already operating in the country, BHP\u2019s Beaven said.\nThe government is taking a more prominent role in taking decisions to improve power supply in Chile, Codelco\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Diego Hernandez said in an April 18 interview in Santiago. Previously, the government limited itself to regulating the sector, he said.\nEconomic Growth\nPinera aims to achieve average economic growth of 6 percent during his four-year term as part of a goal for Chile to become a developed nation by 2018. That plan is contingent on approving power projects, according to a Feb. 28 speech .\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t win this battle to have cheap, clean and safe energy, we won\u2019t become a developed country,\u201d Pinera said.\nChile will seek to \u201csubstantially\u201d increase hydroelectric generation to solve the country\u2019s shortages, Juan Manuel Contreras, executive secretary of the National Energy Commission said April 19. Chile has 9,000 megawatts of untapped hydroelectric power generating capacity, he said.\nChile\u2019s gross domestic product expanded 6 percent last year and 6.1 percent in 2010, the fastest in more than a decade. Economic growth will slow this year to 4.1 percent as the euro- zone crisis reduces demand for exports, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\nThe South American country can reduce consumption by 12 percent through power-saving measures, according to Deputy Energy Minister Sergio del Campo.\nRenewable Energies\nThe country is considering a law that would set Latin America \u2019s highest renewable energy goal and spur $10 billion of investments in clean power projects. Dozens of companies have applied to the environment regulator to build solar farms in the Atacama Desert, the driest place on earth.\nThe extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold Chile\u2019s bonds due in 2021 has fallen to 94 basis points from 116 basis points at the end of 2011. The country\u2019s credit-default swap, a measure of the cost of insuring against default for five years, fell to 97 basis points from 132 basis points on Dec. 30. The benchmark equity index has gained 9.3 percent this year.\nMining companies are considering $100 billion of projects in Chile, home to the world\u2019s largest copper reserves, according to data compiled by mining association Sonami . Peru, the world\u2019s third-largest copper producer, may get $50 billion in mining investments over the next decade, according to the country\u2019s energy and mines ministry.\nLower Quality Ore\nMore energy is needed as mining companies develop deposits with lower quality ore, as they need to move more earth to extract the same amount of copper.\nChile\u2019s copper output has slumped this year due to declining ore at mines including Codelco\u2019s flagship Chuquicamata that is a century old.\nCodelco needs to spend more than $20 billion to boost output to 2.1 million metric tons by 2020 from about 1.7 million now, Hernandez said. Without those investments, Codelco\u2019s output will slump to 800,000 tons a year in that timeframe as the company exhausts profitable ore at its mines.\nChina \u2019s copper demand will probably grow more than 8 percent annually in the next five years, Andrew Harding , the head of Rio Tinto Group\u2019s copper division, said in an April 17 interview.\nCopper for three-month delivery rose 0.6 percent to $8,197.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange by 10:42 a.m. local time, as all six main metals traded on the exchange gained. The metal has advanced 7.8 percent this year.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Matthew Craze in Santiago at mcraze@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Dale Crofts at dcrofts@bloomberg.net\nPower Shortage Hurts Chile $100 Billion Copper Push\nMorten Andersen/Bloomberg\nState-owned Codelco, the world\u2019s largest copper producer, operates three mines in that region of the country.\nState-owned Codelco, the world\u2019s largest copper producer, operates three mines in that region of the country.

The economy has met that target to date with investment growing 15 percent a year, he said, while the unemployment rate has plunged to 6.5 percent in the three months through July from 9 percent.\n\u201cUnless something very spectacular happens in the international economy, I hope that next year the Chilean economy will keep performing very well,\u201d Pinera said.\nPopularity\nThe resilience of Chile\u2019s economy to the global slowdown hasn\u2019t been reflected in Pinera\u2019s popularity in the polls.\nHis approval rating fell to 27 percent in August -- the lowest level of any president since Chile\u2019s return to democracy in 1990, according to Santiago-based polling company CEP. The survey of 1,512 people had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\nThe country has been convulsed by more than a year of student protests in favor of lower cost and higher quality education. Student leaders such as Camila Vallejo have attracted attention globally while pushing the government to boost spending and limit the role of private industry in education.\nRevenue is pouring into government coffers from the mining industry , which is driving economic growth. Mining projects are \u201cextremely profitable\u201d and are not dependent on copper prices remaining at current levels, Pinera said.\nMining Boom\nCopper prices have averaged $3.60 a pound so far this year, compared with $1.79 a pound from the beginning of 2000 through the end of 2009.\n\u201cThe mining sector in Chile is booming, and I think it will continue growing at a very fast pace,\u201d Pinera said.\nHigh copper prices are helping to increase Chile\u00b4s total sales abroad even as some exporters suffer from a strong peso, Pinera said. Chile\u2019s peso has been the best-performing global currency tracked by Bloomberg so far this year, rising 9.2 percent against the U.S. dollar .\nThe biggest impediment to Chile\u2019s growth may come from the electricity industry. Power supply shortages threaten productivity as authorities block development of new generation projects, central bank President Rodrigo Vergara told reporters last week in Santiago.\nChile needs to double its electricity generating capacity in 12 years, Pinera said, as mining companies such as BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and state-owned Codelco plan $100 billion of expansions, according to Chilean mining society Sonami.\nMining Threat\nReaching that goal has become increasingly difficult after Pinera during his first year in office asked GDF Suez (GSZ) SA to scrap plans to build a 540-megawatt coal-fired power plant on the coast following environmental opposition. And this year an investor in Chile\u2019s largest energy project, the HidroAysen series of hydroelectric plants, said it wanted to delay the project over a lack of political support to proceed.\nMining companies are threatening to delay $18 billion in projects because of high energy prices, water-supply and labor shortages as well as a deceleration in China , Santiago-based newspaper Diario Financiero reported Sept. 8, citing industry sources it didn\u2019t identify.\nPinera downplayed the threat of power shortages slowing investment in the mining industry. The government will promote investment in new plants by establishing a 20-year national energy strategy and accelerating the development of renewable energies, he said.\n\u201cIt is not easy because we are facing a lot of problems with community organizations, environmental groups and also with the judiciary,\u201d he said. \u201cChile is not a rich country in terms of gas, or oil or coal, but we are extremely rich in terms of the energies of the future.\u201d\nPoverty Pledge\nPinera needs to maintain economic growth in order to meet his election pledge to eliminate extreme poverty by the time he leaves office in 2014 and set the stage for Chile to eradicate poverty this decade.\nThe percentage of Chileans living below the poverty level fell to 14.4 percent last year from 15.1 percent in 2009, while extreme poverty, or the percentage of people who can\u2019t afford the basic basket of foods, fell to 2.8 percent in 2011 from 3.7 percent three years ago, according to government data.\n\u201cBefore we took office, the economy was not growing at a fast pace and we had some problems in terms of growth, job creation , investment and productivity,\u201d Pinera said. \u201cOur main commitment was to recover our capacity to grow, create jobs, to increase our productivity, to recover our exports and basically to increase our investment as a percentage of GNP.\u201d\nTo ensure growth, Chilean authorities have created a contingency plan that would entail tapping a $15 billion sovereign wealth fund to boost growth if the global slowdown worsens, Finance Minister Felipe Larrain told reporters in Santiago on May 17. The stimulus would target employment , liquidity and investment.\nWealth and Wine\nWhile in Russian, Pinera signed a free trade agreement with Hong Kong . Chile, which has trade accords with more than 50 countries, wants to double annual trade with Hong Kong to more than $1 billion.\nThe pact is part of a strategy to increase ties with China, which is the biggest buyer of Chilean copper . Chile will consider investing money held in its sovereign wealth funds in Chinese assets, and is exploring ways to diversify its exports to the Asian market, Pinera said.\nOne strategy would be to increase the sale of wine from companies like Santiago-based Vina Concha y Toro SA , which produces the Casillero del Diablo brand. The nation\u2019s wine exports last year totaled $1.7 billion, or 2 percent of total sales abroad, according to central bank data .

The stock will jump 21 percent over the next 12 months, according to the average of four analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg, the most among 10 Latin American beverage companies.\nChile\u2019s biggest wine exporter will report a second consecutive quarterly decline in earnings after Europe\u2019s debt crisis cut sales in its biggest market and a drought reduced grape yields last year, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in Asia tripled in the past five years, part of a strategy to reduce dependence on Europe that helped prompt Rodrigo Rojas, who manages Chile\u2019s best performing equity fund this year at Santiago-based Celfin Capital SA, to buy the stock.\n\u201cI like what Concha & Toro is doing to reduce exposure to developed markets and increase sales to emerging markets ,\u201d Rojas, whose $17 million Celfin Chile Accion (CCHIABA) fund has gained 13 percent this year, said in an interview yesterday. \u201cWith the shares near 900 pesos, it showed an interesting entry point.\u201d\nThe fund doubled its Concha & Toro holdings in July to 536,000 shares, from 253,000 at the end of June, according to data from Chile\u2019s securities regulator.\n40% Discount\nThe stock, which retreated 0.2 percent yesterday to 931.35 pesos, trades at 13.8 times trailing 12-month earnings, 28 percent below its four-year average of 19.2 times. The stock traded on July 19 at a 40 percent discount to the benchmark Ipsa stock gauge, the biggest since 2004, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nConcha & Toro got 33 percent of its sales from Europe in the first quarter, down from 38 percent in the same period a year earlier. It increased the percentage of sales to Asia to 8 percent from 6.8 percent. The International Monetary Fund forecasts emerging Asian economies will expand 7.1 percent this year, compared with a 0.3 percent contraction for the euro area,| where a sovereign debt crisis is curbing growth.\nThe company sold 1.8 million cases in Asia last year, up from 573,000 in 2005, according to a presentation on its website. It opened an office in Singapore in 2010 to oversee sales in the region, the website shows.\nCalifornia Wines\nThe vintner\u2019s $234 million acquisition of California winemaker Fetzer Vineyards last year bolstered its U.S. revenue to 22 percent of total sales in the first quarter from 12 percent a year earlier.\nThe press office at Concha & Toro declined to make Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Guilisasti or Chairman Alfonso Larrain available to comment. The company said by e-mail that it will report second-quarter results tomorrow or Aug. 27.\nEarnings and profit margins will begin to improve in the third quarter as a bumper harvest leads to lower prices for fruit and bulk wine and the company recovers from an 8.8- magnitude temblor in 2010 that smashed casks holding 125 million liters of wine industrywide, according to Ramon Lagos, a Santiago-based analyst at Banco Penta SA who says Concha & Toro is part of its portfolio of favorite stocks.\nChile \u2019s grape harvest rose 20 percent in 2012 to produce a record 1.26 billion liters of wine, Chile\u2019s agricultural statistics agency Odepa, said in July. Concha & Toro relies on external grape producers for 65 percent of its premium, varietal and sparkling wines, according to a regulatory report.\n\u201cConcha & Toro is a well-liked company in Chile, but it was affected in the last two years by the earthquake,\u201d Lagos said in an interview. \u201cMargins are expected to improve as this year\u2019s harvest has been much better.\u201d\nBuy Recommendations\nFive analysts have made new or reiterated buy recommendations for Concha & Toro shares or American depositary receipts within the last three months, while two have hold ratings and one a sell, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u201cWith higher sales volumes and if the exchange rate remains stable, Concha & Toro should show efficiency improvements,\u201d Ignacio Spencer, an analyst at Santiago-based brokerage IM Trust, said in a phone interview Aug. 20. He rates the stock buy with a price target of 1,149 pesos.\nConcha & Toro is the biggest winemaker in Chile, with about 30 percent of the market in 2011, according to a company presentation. The company said in April that it planned to invest $60 million to add 540 hectares (1,334 acres) of grape plantations this year.\nConcha & Toro\u2019s earnings excluding certain items probably fell 19 percent in the second quarter to 7.74 billion pesos ($16 million), according to the average estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\nProfit Margins\nConcha & Toro said July 6 that preliminary second-quarter sales rose 6.8 percent from a year ago to 108 billion pesos, with a 6.3 percent increase in export volumes to 42.2 million liters.\nPublicly traded Chilean wine producers have reported an average 58 percent drop in operating margins since the third quarter of 2008, when the financial crisis began, to the first quarter of this year.\nThe strength of the Chilean peso may continue sapping profits of exporters, including Concha & Toro, according to Gabriela Clivio, an equity strategist at Santiago-based asset management firm Vantrust Capital. The peso is the world\u2019s second-best performing currency this year, rallying 7.8 percent.\n\u201cThe stock is still near historic minimums, so some can say it\u2019s cheap, but I don\u2019t see a short term catalyst as there still is just too much concern about the situation in Europe ,\u201d Clivio said in a phone interview Aug. 20.\nCelfin\u2019s Rojas said that even with the European headwinds, as long as second-quarter sales aren\u2019t \u201cdrastically\u201d below forecasts, the stock will be poised for gains.\n\u201cAt this price it remains as one of the bets in our portfolio,\u201d Rojas said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Eduardo Thomson in Santiago at ethomson1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Papadopoulos at papadopoulos@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:52:17", "post_time": "2012-08-23 00:00:38", "author": "Eduardo Thomson", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-23/chile-wine-in-asia-boosts-concha-toro-as-europe-shrinks.html", "title": "Chile Wine in Asia Boosts Concha & Toro as Europe Shrinks", "post_date": "2012-08-23", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "CHILE65", "embers_id": "465c4be772f3ec037f835316881dcda261253b99"}, {"content": "Concha & Toro First-Quarter Profit Falls to 5.23 Billion Pesos\nBy James Attwood - 2012-05-21T13:31:40Z\nVina Concha & Toro SA, Chile \u2019s largest winemaker, had first-quarter net income of 5.23 billion pesos compared with 6.48 billion pesos a year earlier, according to data on the Chilean securities regulator\u2019s website.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: James Attwood in Santiago at jattwood3@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:52:18", "post_time": "2012-05-21 09:31:40", "author": "James Attwood", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-21/concha-toro-first-quarter-profit-falls-to-5-23-billion-pesos.html", "title": "Concha & Toro First-Quarter Profit Falls to 5.23 Billion Pesos", "post_date": "2012-05-21", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "CHILE65", "embers_id": "66326e2a2be58da0fad3fcbc3535749564f63f4e"}, {"content": "Wine Turns Mortgage Title Mogul Into Entrepreneur of Viticulture\nBy Edward Robinson and Ryan Flinn - 2012-02-17T10:45:28Z\nBloomberg Markets Magazine\nOn a crisp winter\u2019s day in 2010, Bill Foley was exploring a troubled winery for sale in Sonoma County, California , when he was taken aback by the sight of an enclosed horse-riding ring the size of an airplane hangar.\nFoley, who made a fortune selling mortgage title insurance during the housing boom , also recalls seeing a California mission-style chapel and a regulation-sized football field and baseball diamond at the Chalk Hill Estate. These extravagant structures had nothing to do with making wine and helped saddle an estate valued at more than $100 million with excessive debt, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its March issue.\n\u201cMy wife said, \u2018There\u2019s no way you can buy this,\u2019\u201d Foley recalls with a mischievous grin.\nFoley, 66, did buy Chalk Hill in June 2010 for an undisclosed price well below its peak valuation. Now, it\u2019s the flagship of his burgeoning viticultural business, which produces more than 1 million cases of wine a year and stretches from California to Washington state to New Zealand .\nFoley is hunting for more distressed wineries along Napa Valley\u2019s fabled Route 29 and in the pinot noir-laden vineyards of Oregon \u2019s Willamette Valley.\n\u201cI\u2019m not even close to being big enough,\u201d says Foley in a mellow voice that bears the twang of his childhood home in the Texas Panhandle.\nThe wealthy have long come to California\u2019s wine country to indulge in the pleasures of the grape. While many are content to lord over one luxury estate, Foley is gambling he can become a commercial force in a wine industry that is struggling with stagnant sales.\nEmpire-Builder\nAfter jumping 37 percent from 2002 to 2007, sales of California-made wine have been flat at about $18 billion for four straight years as consumers drink less expensive brands in economic hard times, according to the Wine Institute, a San Francisco-based trade group.\nDebt-laden producers have sold their operations at deep discounts. In April, Southbank, Australia-based Foster\u2019s Group Ltd. (FGL) spun off its wine division at a $2.5 billion valuation after spending $7 billion building it into a global player with Napa-based Beringer Vineyards and other brands.\nIn exploiting the shake-up, Foley has emerged as the most ambitious individual empire builder in the wine trade since the late Jess Jackson developed chardonnay powerhouse Kendall-Jackson Estate Wine Ltd. in the early 1980s, says Mario Zepponi, a principal at Zepponi & Co., a Santa Rosa , California-based mergers and acquisitions advisory firm.\nMaking Deals\nFoley\u2019s fortune tops $153\u00a0million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Since 2007, he\u00a0has spent more than $200 million of his own money and credit on 12 wineries with more than 20 labels.\n\u201cNobody really knew who this guy was, and then all of a sudden, he was making deals,\u201d Zepponi says. \u201cHe\u2019s been one or two steps ahead of everyone else.\u201d\nFoley\u2019s properties range from Sebastiani Vineyards & Winery, a Sonoma-based producer of $25 reds and whites, to Merus, a Napa cult winery that sells its silky cabernet sauvignon for $135 a bottle. His holding company, Foley Family Wines, recorded $15 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization on about $100 million of sales in 2011.\nMore buyers are now joining the hunt for undervalued wineries. In March 2011, Chilean producer Vina Concha & Toro SA paid $238 million, double Foley\u2019s bid, for Sonoma County-based Fetzer Vineyards, which makes 2.2 million cases annually.\nFragmented Market\nAnd French entrepreneur Jean-Charles Boisset has spent almost $40 million in the past three years to build his own California wine domain with the acquisitions of Raymond Vineyards in Napa and Buena Vista Winery in Sonoma. In 2010 and 2011, two dozen wineries changed hands in California in a record spate of acquisitions, Zepponi says.\nIn storming the wine business, Foley says his private- equity-style deal-making will tame an inefficient industry. From 1984 to 2007, he transformed a Phoenix storefront operation called Fidelity National Title Inc. (FNF) into the No.\u00a01 U.S. mortgage title insurer by acquiring more than 50 firms and absorbing their market share and customers.\nNow, he wants to do the same in wine, a fragmented market teeming with more than 7,600 producers in the U.S. alone. In every winery deal , Foley has shunned short-term debt in favor of using 25- or 30-year loans and then capped his leverage at 30 percent of his invested capital.\nKicking Himself\nHe favors aggressive lowball bids. In 2010, he pursued a prestigious New Zealand pinot noir producer called Te Kairanga with a book value of $20 million. Foley got it for $8 million.\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything I haven\u2019t already done,\u201d Foley says with a shrug. \u201cYou buy companies, collapse the back office, keep the front office and enhance the marketing and sales programs.\u201d\nFoley is betting that a combination of greater wine volume and improved branding will elevate his labels in a market flooded with them. After every acquisition, Foley pumps his new wines into his existing distribution channels to stores and restaurants.\nHe says he must add cases to get more clout with distributors, who choose which wines to showcase for retailers and which to shunt off to the back of the warehouse. So he\u2019s hunting for farms in California\u2019s Central Valley to produce more wine for his many labels and for brands already popular with consumers.\nFoley is still kicking himself for letting a Central California producer called Four Vines Winery get snapped up by another suitor in 2010 for an undisclosed bid. Priced below $20 a bottle, the winery\u2019s Naked Chardonnay and zesty zinfandels are a smash with budget-conscious buyers, and the winery produces about 100,000 cases annually.\nBlackberry Finish\n\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thing I\u2019m looking for, something that\u2019s got some pull to it and distributor relationships,\u201d Foley says. \u201cI\u2019ve got to find one like that.\u201d\nFoley became smitten with the vineyard life in the mid- 1990s after moving to Santa Barbara and discovering the nearby Santa Ynez Valley, a savannah of oaks and ranchland nestled between coastal hills that\u2019s ideal for growing the finicky pinot noir grape. In 1996, Foley bought a 30-acre (12-hectare) winery there and dubbed it Lincourt after his daughters, Lindsay and Courtney.\nAfter every harvest, Foley visits with the vintners on many of his properties as they blend different batches of juice into a wine ready for aging. Camille Benitah, the Bordeaux-born winemaker at Merus, says Foley relishes being in the barrel room and exploring how to balance earthiness, acidity and fruit into an elegant cabernet sauvignon.\nA Grand Improvisation\n\u201cHe is very humble about it,\u201d says Benitah, sampling a 2007 Merus with a nose of pipe tobacco and a long blackberry finish. \u201cHe lets us work, and he sees we are creating something special, something we won\u2019t compromise, and he loves to see it happen.\u201d\nAs a venture that blends agriculture and selling luxury goods , making wine has broken the hearts and bank accounts of many would-be vintners. Foley\u2019s moves appear to be a grand improvisation rather than a carefully plotted campaign, says Vic Motto, chairman of Global Wine Partners LLC , a St. Helena , California-based investment bank.\nFoley not only wants to be both a mass-market producer and the proprietor of fine wine boutiques; he even muses about opening a luxury hotel in the Napa Valley . Motto says Foley\u2019s rapid accumulation of properties is unorthodox in a business where vintners favor building a wine group organically over many years.\n\u2018No Master Plan\u2019\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anyone using his own capital to buy distressed assets and then try and put them together into a working unit,\u201d says Motto, a 30-year Napa veteran. \u201cHe will have to do a lot of work to accomplish that.\u201d\nSeated at a round table in his Chalk Hill office and tapping a stack of business cards from wine industry contacts with his finger, Foley seems more amused than stressed by the challenges before him. Dressed in blue jeans and wearing his snowy hair long, he\u2019s a cheerful man who pokes fun at himself.\nWhen told that vintners in Napa wonder what his strategic objective is, he guffaws. \u201cThey give me too much credit!\u201d he says with a high-pitched giggle. \u201cThere is no master plan.\u201d\nUnderneath his avuncular exterior lies a steeliness borne of years of deals in the mortgage industry, says Thomas Hagerty, his friend and a managing director at Boston-based buyout firm Thomas H. Lee Partners LP. He says Foley is skilled at finding troubled companies, stripping out valuable assets and integrating them into his own group.\nRare Skills\nIn 2010, Foley was eager to improve sales at Firestone Vineyard, a Santa Ynez producer of $20 reds and whites he bought three years earlier for $50 million. The problem was, its tasting room was located in Paso Robles, a viticultural area an hour\u2019s drive north of Santa Ynez.\nSo Foley bought a Paso Robles-based producer called Eos Estate Winery out of bankruptcy and converted the Firestone tasting room into an Eos showcase, appealing to visitors who prefer locally produced wines. Sales at the tasting room quickly doubled, he says.\n\u201cBill has a deep understanding of financial risk and operational risk, and it\u2019s rare to see those two skills in one guy,\u201d Hagerty says. \u201cHe does love wine, but he\u2019s not a hobbyist. He\u2019s in this to build a first-class business.\u201d\nFoley graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in West Point , New York , in 1967 with an engineering degree and then switched from the Army to the Air Force , serving four years and earning the rank of captain. He went on to receive a Master of Business Administration at Seattle University and a law degree from the University of Washington .\nMarket Leader\nAfter moving to Phoenix and working as a real-estate lawyer, he took control of Fidelity National Title in 1984 through a leveraged buyout. The company, which protects mortgage lenders from losses in the event a home seller lacks clear title to a property, had $6 million in annual sales and was then the No. 92 title insurer in the U.S.\nBy March 2000, Foley had renamed the company Fidelity National Financial Inc. and had made it the No. 1 mortgage title insurer after acquiring archrival Chicago Title Corp. for $1.1 billion.\nThe following year, Foley launched a subsidiary called Fidelity National Information Services Inc. (FIS) that sold data- management software to mortgage companies. He catapulted the venture into a market leader in 2003 with the $1 billion purchase of the financial services arm of Alltel Corp., which serviced almost half of the home loans in the U.S.\nHousing Crash\nIn 2006, he spun it off\u00a0in an offering that created $7.6 billion in market capitalization. The total value of Foley\u2019s stakes in both his companies soared to $454 million in 2007.\nAs subprime mortgages started defaulting en masse, Foley stepped down as chief executive officer of Fidelity National Financial in May 2007. He gave up day-to-day management just as the firm\u2019s fortunes were undermined by the housing crash: Net income at the company slid to $130 million in 2007 from a peak of $964 million in 2005, and in 2008 the company lost $179 million. Foley, who remains chairman, says that after 23 years in title insurance, he wanted to spend more time playing golf and tending to his vineyards.\nRather than ease into semiretirement, Foley had to overcome distribution problems at his fledgling wine business. Two years after setting up Lincourt in 1996, Foley bought a 460-acre Thoroughbred ranch nearby and planted it with pinot noir and chardonnay grapes. He dubbed it Foley Estates. He says both wineries, in which he\u2019d invested $18 million, were headed for disaster as unsold inventory piled up.\nElegant and Complex\n\u201cI wanted to learn how you make wine, and I\u2019d sunk all this money into it,\u201d Foley says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018God, I have to do something. I\u2019ve got 20,000 cases of wine from last year, and this year I\u2019m going to have another 25,000, and I\u2019m selling 2,000?\u2019 It was hilarious.\u201d\nDetermined to make inroads with distributors, Foley bought Firestone Vineyard, which produced 140,000 cases a year in Santa Ynez Valley. The next year, he acquired Sebastiani, a 109-year- old winery that epitomizes California\u2019s Italian winemaking roots and cranks out 250,000 cases a year.\nIn early 2010, Foley cast his eye on Chalk Hill. Cobbled together from 13 parcels over 38 years by San Francisco plaintiff lawyer Fred Furth, it emerged as a premier label that delivered elegant and complex wines for about $50 and up.\nBy the time Foley arrived, its high-alcohol reds and whites had lost suppleness and cachet and were no longer selling like those of Frog\u2019s Leap, Cakebread Cellars and other peers, says Kerrin Laz, wine director at Dean & DeLuca Inc. , a chain of gourmet grocery emporiums based in New York.\nGrey Fungus\n\u201cAll those wines still maintained relevance,\u201d she says. \u201cChalk Hill did not.\u201d\nDuring harvest in early fall, Foley saw how difficult his new career could be when unseasonal rains drenched Sonoma just as the grapes were reaching peak ripeness. The moisture caused a countywide outbreak of botrytis, a gray fungus that spoils grapes, and Chalk Hill lost about half of its chardonnay crop. The development raises concerns about the 2011 vintage\u2019s volume.\n\u201cIf you run out of product and lose shelf space, somebody else will get that slot,\u201d says Mark Lingenfelder, Chalk Hill\u2019s vineyard manager.\nFoley takes the news in stride as he visits with guests of the estate on an October afternoon. He says the Chalk Hill brand possesses prestige to build on, and thanks to his deals, he\u2019s finally getting his labels onto the shelves of mass-market retailers such as BevMo Inc., a 114-store chain in California and Arizona .\nApples and Nectarines\nA glass of Chalk Hill\u2019s 2009 chardonnay is placed in front of Foley. The scent of apples and nectarines wafts from the wine. One of his guests compliments the estate\u2019s Olympic-sized equestrian ring and asks whether Foley rides horses. He shakes his head and says he\u2019s a cyclist.\n\u201cI was thinking of going this afternoon,\u201d Foley says, swirling his wine. \u201cBut now I\u2019m going to drink this chardonnay.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Edward Robinson in San Francisco at edrobinson@bloomberg.net ; Ryan Flinn in San Francisco at rflinn@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Laura Colby in New York at lcolby@bloomberg.net ; Reg Gale at rgale5@bloomberg.net\nWine Turns Mortgage Title Mogul Into Entrepreneur\nChip Chipman/Bloomberg\nGrapevines line a vineyard in Napa, California.\nGrapevines line a vineyard in Napa, California.

Timber prices to Asia fell in the first quarter, the company said.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Matt Craze in Santiago at mcraze@bloomberg.net ; Sebastian Boyd in Santiago at sboyd9@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Dale Crofts at dcrofts@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:52:28", "post_time": "2012-05-29 13:10:01", "author": "Matt Craze , Sebastian Boyd", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-29/chile-s-top-pulp-maker-says-prices-rebounded-in-1st-quarter-1-.html", "title": "Chile\u2019s Top Pulp Maker Says Prices Rebounded in 1st Quarter", "post_date": "2012-05-29", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "CHILE65", "embers_id": "3ab1d4eed6610e5340776c4c53abd855baf099ed"}, {"content": "Helm Controller Says No \u2018Definitive\u2019 Deal Reached for Stake Sale\nBy Christine Jenkins and Andrea Jaramillo - 2012-08-10T22:13:04Z\nHelm Corp., the holding company that controls Helm Bank SA (PFBHELMB) , said it is studying options for its controlling stake in the Bogota-based lender and that no \u201cdefinitive\u201d agreement has been reached.\nThe holding company said in a regulatory filing after the market closed that it \u201ccontinues in the process of evaluating different strategic business alternatives for the bank and no definitive transaction has been finalized.\u201d\nLa Republica newspaper reported Aug. 6 that Chile\u2019s Corpbanca (CORPBANC) agreed to acquire Helm Bank for more than $1.3 billion.\nSpeculation about a takeover has helped drive Helm Bank up 62 percent this year, outpacing the benchmark IGBC Index\u2019s 9.5 percent gain.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Christine Jenkins in Bogota at cjenkins28@bloomberg.net Andrea Jaramillo in Bogota at ajaramillo1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Papadopoulos at papadopoulos@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:52:31", "post_time": "2012-08-10 18:13:04", "author": "Christine Jenkins , Andrea Jaramillo", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-10/helm-controller-says-no-definitive-deal-reached-for-stake-sale.html", "title": "Helm Controller Says No \u2018Definitive\u2019 Deal Reached for Stake Sale", "post_date": "2012-08-10", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "CHILE65", "embers_id": "19c5b33fc030f68c69b02358ee16b45d94453278"}, {"content": "Helm Bank Tumbles as Corpbanca Says It Won\u2019t Bid: Bogota Mover\nBy Christine Jenkins - 2012-06-26T21:02:54Z\nHelm Bank SA dropped to the lowest in three weeks after the president of Chile \u2019s Corpbanca (CORPBANC) said his company won\u2019t bid for a stake in the Colombian bank.\nShares dropped 4 percent to 475 pesos, the lowest close since June 5.

He moved into money management in the trust department of Memphis\u2019s own, now- defunct Union Planters Bank. After getting a pink slip in 1989 when the bank sold its asset management unit, he could have sought work among the big fund firms in New York and Boston . Instead, he stayed in Memphis and started SouthernSun Asset Management LLC .\nCook\u2019s out-of-the-way location has done nothing to hurt performance, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its May issue. His $300 million small-cap fund returned an annualized average of 41.1 percent per year for the three years ended on Feb. 17, helping him win the top spot in the U.S. small-cap category in Bloomberg Markets\u2019 annual ranking of mutual funds. Average total return for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index (SPX) for the same period was 22.5 percent.\nCook\u2019s fund, whose largest investments are in agriculture and construction equipment companies, was tied for third-best in a ranking of all U.S. diversified funds.\nThe ranking measures market performance in a time of huge volatility, with stocks and bonds crashing in 2008 and shooting up in 2009. Cook\u2019s fund is an example; it gained just 9.7 percent on average over five years. The S&P 500 Index returned 0.8 percent annually in the same period.\nFive Criteria\nThe Bloomberg Markets stock and bond fund rankings include U.S.-domiciled funds with at least $250 million under management. Funds are ranked by total returns for one, three and five years and by their Sharpe ratios for three and five years. The Sharpe ratio measures the performance of a fund adjusted for risk.\nFive of the top 10 funds in the diversified U.S. equities fund ranking manage small-cap or midcap stocks.\n\u201cSmaller companies tend to have more business risk, and they can be a little more volatile than large-cap funds,\u201d says Katie Reichart, a senior fund analyst at Chicago-based research firm Morningstar Inc. \u201cBut small-cap value funds, in particular, have had some of the best long-term returns.\u201d\nSouthernSun is such a fund. The category had an annualized return of 32 percent during the three years through March 12, compared with 23 percent for large-cap value funds, according to Morningstar. Over five years, small value had a 2.6 percent return, outperforming large value by more than 2 percentage points.\nIben Changes Jobs\nGlobal equity funds showed the same pattern as small caps, with high returns over three years and modest results over five. The good news for Chicago-based Nuveen Investments , a unit of Madison Dearborn Partners LLC, is that funds managed by David Iben continued to dominate the global equity category, taking three of the top four spots. In Bloomberg Markets\u2019 2011 ranking, funds managed by Iben were Nos. 1, 2 and 4.\nThe bad news for Nuveen is that Iben, head of the firm\u2019s Tradewinds Global Investors subsidiary, will leave in June to join Boston-based hedge fund Vinik Asset Management LP, founded by former Fidelity Investments stock picker Jeffrey Vinik.\nNuveen spokeswoman Kathleen Cardoza says that Iben will be missed but that Tradewinds has a \u201cdeep team\u201d of fund managers. He will be replaced by Emily Alejos and Andrew Thelen, Nuveen veterans who will serve as co-chief investment officers.\nPrudential Fund No. 1\nIn global bonds, the $1.6 billion Prudential Total Return Bond Fund (PDBAX) was No. 1 after returning 12.6 percent annually during the three years ended on Feb. 17. The fund, run by Newark , New Jersey-based Prudential Financial Inc.\u2019s Prudential Investments LLC, competes with go-anywhere bond funds such as Bill Gross \u2019s Pimco Total Return Fund and William Eigen\u2019s JPMorgan Strategic Income Opportunities Fund.\nMichael Collins , who\u2019s the lead manager of the Prudential fund, attributes its strong risk-adjusted returns to his desire to keep the fund diversified.\n\u201cA lot of our competitors seem to have a bias toward being overweight in specific areas, an example being a big interest- rate bet or a global macro bet,\u201d Collins says. \u201cWe\u2019ll rotate aggressively across sectors, but we always ensure that we don\u2019t have too many eggs in one basket.\u201d\nCollins says he knows bond returns will suffer when interest rates rise, yet he\u2019s confident demographic trends will keep bond funds popular. As the U.S. baby boomer generation heads into retirement, more investors, he says, will be relying on the relative safety of debt.\n2020 Fund Wins\nThe top U.S. bond fund is the $303 million American Century Investment Zero Coupon 2020 Fund (BTTTX) , which took advantage of the spike in the value of intermediate and long-term U.S. Treasuries. The fund invests primarily in zero-coupon securities that mature in 2020, when the fund will liquidate. It returned 13.8 percent annualized during the past three years and 15 percent over five years.\nThe fund, managed by Robert Gahagan and James Platz, is one of a series of funds opened by Kansas City , Missouri-based American Century Investment Management Inc. in 1985 and whose bond purchases are set to five-year intervals.\nMuch of its holdings are in U.S. Treasury strips: bonds whose coupon payments have been packaged and sold separately, leaving only the maturity payment for the holder. They\u2019re typically sold at a discount. The fund appeals to investors who know they\u2019ll need a payout in or near 2020.\nGahagan, 53, says that investors aren\u2019t likely to flee even if interest rates rise, which will drive down the price of bonds.\nVolatile, Predictable\n\u201cThe fund can be volatile, but, remember, many investors have locked in a predictable rate of return,\u201d he says.\nSouthernSun\u2019s Cook is a plain-spoken Southerner who gave up his religion and philosophy studies at Covenant College in Lookout Mountain, Georgia , before going into finance. He relies on his love of research and of \u201cgood old-fashioned logic\u201d to generate returns for his investors. He\u2019s suspicious of what he sees as the tendency of many asset managers to overcomplicate the process.\n\u201cWe have become mesmerized by what we think complex algorithmic notions can yield,\u201d Cook says. \u201cBy digitizing things, we think we have all the necessary information to correct anything, and it\u2019s just not true.\u201d\nCook has always focused on small to midsize companies because they, too, keep things simple and are best at turning good management decisions into profits.\n\u2018A Unique Niche\u2019\n\u201cWe make sure the business has a unique niche and has a process where they can move ideas to execution,\u201d he says.\nHis favorite current investment is Agco Corp. (AGCO) , a Duluth, Georgia, agriculture equipment maker.\nCook manages a total of $2.6 billion, most of it in separate accounts for institutional investors -- one of which is Memphis-based FedEx Corp. (FDX) SouthernSun slowly built its client list from local families and businesses. Cook\u2019s first client was his father, who, Cook says, still calls him twice a week \u201cto tell me what I\u2019m doing wrong.\u201d\nCook began marketing his firm when he launched the mutual fund in 2003. Focused on companies with a market capitalization of $500 million to $2 billion, it\u2019s his only retail fund. As its returns have climbed, so have its assets, swelling almost fourfold in the 15 months ended on Feb. 29. Cook runs an investment team of five people, including his 30-year-old son, Phillip.\nWhile Cook stresses simplicity in value-oriented stock picking, he emphasizes that it\u2019s also rigorous.\n\u2018Limb From Limb\u2019\n\u201cWe pore over the financials, tear them limb from limb, visit the management,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to be able to understand who the critical decision makers are.\u201d\nAfter months of study, the fund typically takes a position no larger than 1 to 1.5 percent of its assets when it first invests in a company.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you ever really know a business until you own it,\u201d he says. \u201cOur philosophy is never to make huge mistakes.\u201d\nThe fund\u2019s largest holding as of Dec. 31 was Darling International Inc. (DAR) , a recycler of animal byproducts based in Irving, Texas , which returned an annualized 75 percent during the three years ended on March 12. The stock of another holding, Brentwood, Tennessee-based Tractor Supply Co. (TSCO) , also rose an average of 75 percent over the period.\nCook says the firm will open its second mutual fund in the spring. It will follow an investment strategy -- initiated in 1996 for the firm\u2019s institutional accounts -- that focuses on companies with a market cap of $1 billion to $8 billion.\n\u201cOur intent is just to keep plugging away,\u201d Cook says. \u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll make our clients money and not overly impress them with a process.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Christopher Condon in Boston at ccondon4@bloomberg.net .\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael Serrill at mserrill@bloomberg.net ; Christian Baumgaertel at cbaumgaertel@bloomberg.net .\nEnlarge image\nMichael Cook, manager of Southern Asset Management\nMichael Cook, manager of Southern Asset Management, sits for a photograph  outside of his office in Memphis, Tennessee on March 13, 2012.

The project will be the Paris-based utility\u2019s biggest for exploration and production with investment of 2.3 billion euros ($3 billion).\nProduction at Touat, about 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) southwest of Algiers, depends on the construction by Sonatrach of a pipeline linking the field to its northern network. GDF Suez (GSZ) will build a plant to treat gas before it\u2019s transported.\nAlgeria is GDF Suez\u2019s third-biggest supplier through long- term contracts after Norway and Russia , providing 12 percent of its total demand, according to the company\u2019s 2011 annual report.\nThe utility signed a supply deal last year with Sonatrach for 1 billion cubic meters a year of gas over 20 years through the Medgaz undersea pipeline linking Algeria and Spain .\nDeveloping the Touat project has been repeatedly delayed amid discussions about how the natural gas will be transported. GDF Suez, which became a partner a decade ago, expects 40 wells to be drilled in various phases of the project, expected to produce as much as 4.5 billion cubic meters a year at plateau.\nThe company also drilled a well in the eastern Sud-Illizi bloc in July and is evaluating its commercial viability.\nThe utility\u2019s proven and probable gas reserves at the end of 2011 were 789 million barrels of oil equivalent of which nearly three quarters was natural gas.

The stock has surged 23 percent this year as the Ipsa index slumped 20 percent. Entel fetches 12 times trailing earnings, versus 15 for the Ipsa, while its estimated dividend yield of 5 percent compares with an average 2.3 percent for Ipsa members, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe company, sold by Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) to local business group Almendral SA (ALMEN) in 2005, has banked on data services and post-paid contracts to boost growth. First-half profit jumped 32 percent to 104 billion pesos ($203 million) from a year earlier, while active clients rose 22 percent to 8.3 million and mobile broadband customers more than doubled to 813,000.\n\u2018Defensive\u2019 Stock\nEntel\u2019s total debt represents 50.3 percent of equity compared with the Ipsa average\u2019s 108 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a defensive stock and pays good dividends,\u201d said Luarte, who manages $92 million of local equities for Euroamerica Administradora General de Fondos SA . \u201cIt\u2019s a stock that makes us really happy in times like these when the market is down.\u201d\nLuarte\u2019s Euroamerica Ventaja Local fund first bought Entel shares about five months ago and the stock now accounts for about 9 percent of holdings. The fund has declined 18 percent this year, the second-best performance after the 13 percent drop by Larrain Vial\u2019s Beagle among funds that have solely Chilean stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The peer average is a decline of 26 percent. Beagle returned 82 percent last year, beating all other Chile-based funds.\nBeagle focuses on small-cap stocks and doesn\u2019t own Entel. Larrain Vial\u2019s Acciones Beneficio and Acciones Nacionales funds have added to their holdings of Entel, and the shares accounted for 7.3 percent of Beneficio\u2019s holdings and 7.5 percent of Nacionales as of last month, up from 3 percent and 4.6 percent in May, according to data from the securities regulator.\nExpansion Plans\nEntel plans to invest $673 million this year, as part of a budgeted $2 billion capital expenditure over three years, after spending $576 million last year. The company aims to increase mobile broadband customers fivefold to 3 million by 2014, Chairman Juan Hurtado said April 26. Entel registered in July to sell as much as $470 million in inflation-linked bonds.\nEntel has a \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation by seven of 11 analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The other four rate the stock \u201chold.\u201d Chief Executive Officer Antonio Buchi and Chief Financial Officer Felipe Ureta didn\u2019t respond to requests seeking comment.\nThe stock\u2019s outperformance this year can be explained by its underperformance in previous years, Rodrigo Rojas, a fund manager at Celfin Capital SA, said in a Sept. 6 interview.\nDiscount Reduced\nEntel rose 12 percent last year while the Ipsa surged 38 percent. The stock climbed 5.7 percent in 2009 against the index\u2019s 51 percent jump. This year\u2019s gain has reduced the discount that Entel trades relative to the index to the lowest level in two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nLast year \u201cwas a good entry point, but the low hanging fruit isn\u2019t there anymore,\u201d Eric Conrads, who manages $1.2 billion in Latin American stocks at ING Groep NV said by phone from New York . \u201cYou probably have some better stories within Chile from a relative point of view.\u201d\nThe company faces rising competition in a country where there is already more than one mobile phone per person. VTR Globalcom SA, a unit of Englewood, Colorado-based Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA) and Chile\u2019s Saieh Group, and Reston, Virginia-based NII Holdings Inc. plan to start mobile operations in Chile this year. Also Grupo GTD, a data services and cable TV provider, is preparing to begin virtual mobile operations.\n\u2018Reduce Margins\u2019\n\u201cThere\u2019s no certainty on the effect that the entry of the new rivals will have,\u201d German Guerrero, a partner at Santiago- based MBI Corredores de Bolsa SA, said in a Sept. 7 telephone interview. \u201cThey may want to gain market share through a price war and that will reduce margins for the whole industry.\u201d\nEntel may be able to more easily wrest customers from competitors with the government\u2019s plans to start introducing number portability by the end of this year, Luarte said.\n\u201cThey are very interested in providing a good client service,\u201d he said. \u201cNumber portability may be seen as a cause of uncertainty but they have said that they look forward to it.

The new shares will be sold before Oct. 29 as part of an agreement with creditors.\nThe Santiago-based company said in June 2011 that it had been unilaterally restructuring terms of clients\u2019 past due loans as a way to cap loss provisions and boost profit.\nAbout 100 billion pesos from the share sale will be used to refurbish stores and fund consumer loans in Chile and Colombia, and 20 billion pesos will go toward compensating  customers affected by the loan modifications, according to a presentation on the company\u2019s website.\nLa Polar will seek to cater to a wider variety of clients instead of only middle- and lower-income segments, Lecaros said. \u201cWe want to take a little bit of market share from each of the three bigger players, but not too much to make them mad,\u201d Lecaros said. The biggest department store operators in Chile are SACI Falabella (FALAB) , Cencosud SA and Ripley Corp SA. (RIPLEY)\nThe company will open its fifth store in Colombia in November.

The stock plunged 38 percent in the four months after La Polar said it hid $1 billion of customer loan delinquencies, a cover-up that has led to the trial of four former executives and prompted the government to seek tighter lending rules.\nWith shares trading at 16.4 times trailing earnings, Ripley\u2019s valuation is 16 percent below that of companies in the benchmark IPSA index. That\u2019s less than the record 19 percent discount on Sept. 30. The rebound shows that concern the government\u2019s move to lower maximum interest rates banks and department stores charge consumers in response to La Polar\u2019s case would reduce Ripley\u2019s profit is easing, said Carles Gaju, a fund manager at Bice Inversiones Adm. General de Fondos SA.\n\u201cThe market has paid too much attention to potential changes to the maximum rate,\u201d said Gaju, who manages the Bice Chile Activo mutual fund, the third-best performing Chilean equity mutual fund, with a 17 percent decline in the last 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cThe effect of lower rates will be less than what the market was thinking. The announcements scared retail investors and that created opportunities.\u201d\nPolar Tumbles\nFinancial services account for 11 percent of Ripley\u2019s total revenue, according to data posted on the website of Chile\u2019s securities regulator. This compares with 7 percent at SACI Falabella (FALAB) and 3.5 percent for Cencosud SA (CENCOSUD) , the country\u2019s two biggest retailers by market value and sales, respectively, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Falabella trades at 22 times profit, while Cencosud fetches 24.\nLa Polar shares tumbled 90 percent after directors said on June 9 that the company had been secretly restructuring terms of clients past due loans as a way to cap provisions and boost profits. The retailer has since filed for bankruptcy protection and received approval from creditors to restructure debt to continue its operations in Chile and Colombia . Former Chief Executive Pablo Alcalde, one of the four standing trial, says he was unaware of the fraudulent lending and accounting practices.\nRipley, which also has operations in Peru , fell as much as 41 percent in the last 12 months before paring losses to 24 percent. Since hitting a one-year low on Oct. 4, Ripley has risen 27 percent, outperforming Falabella\u2019s 8.6 percent gain and Cencosud\u2019s 17 percent.\nRipley fell 1.6 percent to 495 pesos at 2:54 p.m. in Santiago today after rising as much as 1.2 percent.\nRate Ceiling\nSince the La Polar fraud case, the government submitted a bill to lower the ceiling on consumer loan rates and announced the creation of a consumer protection agency specifically tailored for the financial services industry.\nChilean law allows banks and credit-card operators to charge a maximum 51.4 percent a year for peso loans of up to 90 days worth less than 200 unidades de fomento, the local inflation-adjusted accounting unit, or roughly $8,700, according to data on the banking regulator website.\nThe finance ministry\u2019s bill submitted in September would set a ceiling of 1.35 times the average market interest rate on such loans, from 1.5 times, or the average plus 12 percentage points, whichever is lower. The maximum annual rate may fall to below 40 percent, officials have said.\nSecurity Stake\nFondo Mutuo Security Acciones (SEACCCII) , the best performing Chilean equity mutual fund in the fourth quarter with a 12 percent gain, managed by a unit of Grupo Security SA, increased its investment in Ripley to 5 million shares in December from 87 shares in October, according to data on the securities regulator\u2019s website. Cristian Ureta, the fund\u2019s manager, didn\u2019t respond to phone calls and e-mails seeking comment.\nRipley doesn\u2019t say how much the 11 percent in revenue it derives from financial services contributes to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, Veronica Perez, an analyst at the brokerage unit of Banco de Credito & Inversiones, or BCI, said in an interview.\nBy comparison, for Cencosud, which has stores in five Latin American countries, banking and credit-card operations accounted for 3.5 percent of 2010 sales and 22 percent of profit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Financial services accounted for 6.2 percent of Falabella\u2019s 2010 sales, the data show. Falabella doesn\u2019t provide a breakdown for net income.\nMost Affected\nEmpresas Hites SA (HITES) , another department-store chain, would be most affected by the new rate limits, according to a BCI study published Sept. 22, as the new ceiling could push the average rate it charges to about 31 percent per year from 39 percent. Ripley may see a fall in the average rate to 26 percent from 32 percent, according to BCI. Hites shares fell 53 percent in 2011.\nRipley declined to comment for this article, according to an external public relations representative.\nSlower consumption growth may also hurt Ripley this year, BCI said in the note. Chile\u2019s economy is expected to grow between 3.75 percent and 4.75 percent this year, after expanding about 6.2 percent last year, according to the most recent estimates from the central bank.\nRipley lags larger peers in efficiency indicators, posting return on common equity of 8.52 times at the end of the third quarter compared with 17.9 for Falabella and 10.7 for Cencosud.\n\u201cRipley\u2019s quality of earnings is quite different than Cencosud and Falabella,\u201d said Eric Conrads, who manages $1.2 billion in Latin American stocks at ING Groep NV in New York . \u201cIt\u2019s also much more affected by the sensitivity to the Chilean economy.\u201d\n\u2018A Bet\u2019\nFor Bice\u2019s Gaju, lower profitability and performance indicators at Ripley mean the company has room to improve. He added Ripley shares even after the company reported on Nov. 25 third-quarter earnings that missed analysts\u2019 estimates. The Chile Activo Fund held 2.2 million Ripley stocks as of December, according to data on the website of Chile\u2019s securities regulator, up from 1.8 million in August and 1.3 million in May.\n\u201cBuying Falabella is to play it safe,\u201d he said. \u201cRipley is a bet, but it\u2019s a bet that may double its Ebitda by 2016.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Eduardo Thomson in Santiago at ethomson1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Papadopoulos at papadopoulos@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:54:17", "post_time": "2012-01-10 14:02:12", "author": "Eduardo Thomson", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-10/la-polar-s-1-billion-fraud-fading-as-chilean-rival-ripley-posts-rebound.html", "title": "La Polar\u2019s $1 Billion Fraud Fading as Chilean Rival Ripley Posts Rebound", "post_date": "2012-01-10", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "CHILE65", "embers_id": "7ec11ca06019aba2f047e0bd266889d4f0f08614"}, {"content": "Embraer, Suramericana, Vale: Latin America Equity Preview\nBy Bryan Gibel and Jonathan J.

Norway, the world\u2019s top producer, picked up the slack by boosting exports to the U.S.\n\u201cWe are in negotiations\u201d with Wal-Mart, Lyon said. \u201cIn general the Norwegians are pulling out of the U.S.\u201d he said.\nMultiexport Foods rose 2.4 percent to 129.81 pesos in Santiago trading today as the Ipsa index slid 0.3 percent. The stock has slumped 40 percent this year after surging 155 percent last year. Wal-Mart public relations representatives didn\u2019t immediately return e-mailed and phone messages seeking comment.\nChilean salmon exports may reach $5 billion to $6 billion in two to three years from about $3 billion this year, Economy Minister Pablo Longueira told a conference in Santiago today.\nNorway is producing at close to its maximum capacity of about 1 million metric tons a year and can\u2019t raise output like Chile , Ricardo Garcia, chief executive officer of rival Chilean producer Cia. Pesquera Camanchaca SA said today.\nStricter Standards\nAuthorities will enforce stricter standards in the industry amid a \u201clatent\u201d risk of another outbreak of the ISA virus that caused farmers to incur losses in 2008 and 2009, Longueira said.\nLyon said the industry has implemented tougher standards to prevent new outbreaks of the virus.\nBased in the southern city of Puerto Montt, Multiexport plans to participate in the consolidation of the Chilean salmon- farming industry and is looking at opportunities, Lyon told reporters earlier today.\n\u201cWe are in a solid financial position,\u201d Lyon told reporters at a conference in Santiago, referring to the company\u2019s ability to grow through acquisitions.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Matthew Craze in Santiago at mcraze@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:54:29", "post_time": "2011-09-30 15:39:02", "author": "Matthew Craze", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-30/multiexport-in-talks-to-resume-wal-mart-salmon-sales-ceo-says.html", "title": "Chile\u2019s Multiexport in Talks to Resume Wal-Mart Salmon Sales", "post_date": "2011-09-30", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "CHILE65", "embers_id": "8de498b0b0541c5cd74dae3ed33d84c26070138f"}, {"content": "Coca-Cola Femsa, Hypermarcas, OGX: Latin America Equity Preview\nBy Jonathan J.

Hurdles to expansion include safety issues, corruption, state interference and of selling tickets in economies reliant on cash and lacking ready internet access.\n\u201cWith the right cost structure there\u2019s no reason why airlines shouldn\u2019t succeed,\u201d International Air Transport Association Chief Executive Officer Tony Tyler said by phone from Dakar during a visit to Senegal this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that happen in Asia, Latin America and other parts of the developing world. People here say the easiest way to fly anywhere in Africa is via Paris, which is ridiculous.\u201d\nGulf Carriers\nBritish Airways, a unit of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, added flights to Liberia via Sierra Leone on Sept. 10 and now serves 16 Africa countries. Brussels Airlines - - 45 percent owned by Germany\u2019s Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) -- has almost doubled the number of passengers it carries to the continent since 2008 and founded a subsidiary in the Congo.\nTurkish Airlines (THYAO) is \u201cvery interested\u201d in the continent, CEO Temel Kotil said at a conference on Sept. 9. The carrier will serve 24 cities there as of Nov. 16, when it adds Nouakchott in Mauritania to the network, with about 80 percent of passengers switching flights in Istanbul -- double the usual proportion -- reflecting the relative lack of direct African services.\nGulf carriers are also adding African routes, with Dubai- based Emirates, the world\u2019s biggest airline by international traffic, leading the way with 22 destinations, including the addition this year of Lusaka in Zambia and Harare in Zimbabwe.\nQatar Air will fly to Mozambique from October, its 18th African route, after already adding the sub-Saharan destinations of Mombassa in Kenya, Kilimanjaro in Tanzania and Kigali in Rwanda -- the fastest growing of Africa\u2019s top 25 airports. Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways this year began flights to Nairobi and Lagos, the continent\u2019s two busiest hubs, and will serve Addis Ababa from November for a total of eight African cities.\nBusiness Fleet\nAsian operators are also joining the rush, with China Southern Airlines Co., the nation\u2019s biggest carrier by passenger numbers, prioritizing African expansion above other markets, Si Xianmin, the Guangzhou-based company\u2019s chairman, said June 6.\nAfrican business-aircraft demand is likewise accelerating, with the fleet expanding 25 percent in the 2007-2011 period versus the prior five years to 1,156 planes, Hawker Beechcraft said this month, citing JetNet research. About 40 percent are in South Africa, with 9 percent in Kenya and 6 percent in oil- endowed Nigeria, which accounted for 11 percent of new sales.\nStill, the industry is starting from a low base, adding $8 billion to Africa\u2019s gross domestic product in 2011, the smallest contribution in any continent, and employing 260,000 people, IATA says. That compares with $231.9 billion and 3.1 million jobs in North America, which has the biggest aviation economy.\nEast-West Gap\nAir links have traditionally been strongest with former colonial nations in Europe, in southern and eastern Africa, and on a north-south axis down the continent\u2019s spine. That means growth opportunities are greatest on ill-served east-west routes, both within the region and to the Americas and Asia, said Herman Carpentier, Africa sales chief at Brussels Airlines.\nThe company\u2019s response has been to establish Korongo Airlines, an $11 million joint venture with mining entrepreneur George Forrest\u2019s Groupe Forrest International in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a former Belgian colony where the economy is forecast to grow 3 percent this year.\nThe unit, which operates from Lubumbashi in the south of the country to the capital Kinshasa and to Johannesburg, plans to expand to commercial hub Mbuji-Mayi and mining center Kolwezi in the next year, according to Carpentier, who said the model could be replicated in other African countries if successful.\nPoor Roads\n\u201cThere\u2019s a general lack of intra-African flights, yet other infrastructure is very basic or non-existent in some areas, so air travel is the best way to get around,\u201d Carpentier said in a phone interview from Brussels. \u201cI think there\u2019s real demand.\u201d\nAir Cemac, an airline planned by governments in central Africa, chose Air France-KLM (AF) Group as a strategic partner after terminating an agreement with South African Airways , a spokesman for Gabon\u2019s presidency said last month. Air France is also an investor in Air Cote d\u2019Ivoire, which plans to start next month.\nHigh fuel prices generally viewed as negative for airlines are also driving growth in states with crude deposits, boosting business flights and stirring leisure demand among a nascent middle class. Oil is spurring travel across central Africa, from Angola as far east as Uganda and Kenya, Carpentier said.\nIt\u2019s in the east that FastJet will commence flying with the aim of becoming the first discount carrier to span the region. The company is building a fleet of Airbus SAS A319 jets and will operate first from Tanzania then Kenya, Ghana and Angola using licenses held by majority investor Lonrho Plc (LONR) , a mining, oil and agricultural group active in Africa for more than 100 years.\nRobbed Blind\nThe challenges for such startups are very different from those faced elsewhere, according to Ron Peri, CEO of Orlando- based airline ticketing specialist Radixx International, who sums them up as the \u201cThree Cs\u201d -- for a cash-based economy, the prevalence of corruption, and a general lack of competence.\n\u201cIf you have strong cash markets but not necessarily the strongest personal ethics you wind up with corruption all over the place,\u201d Peri said in an interview. \u201cYou need to have audit trails everywhere. In Africa they talk about \u2018revenue leakage,\u2019 which is shorthand for \u2018my employees are robbing me blind.\u2019\u201d\nGraft isn\u2019t limited to those directly involved in revenue collection, according to IATA\u2019s Tyler.\n\u201cGovernments can\u2019t stop interfering and squeezing to try and get money,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should look at aviation not as a cash cow to be milked but as an engine for economic growth which in the long run will provide much more tax revenue , employment and social development. We\u2019ve seen that happen in Asia.\u201d\nSAA Resignations\nEight directors at state-owned South African Airways, the continent\u2019s biggest carrier, resigned after a disagreement with the government ahead of the release of financial results, Chairwoman Cheryl Carolus -- who was one of those who quit -- told Johannesburg\u2019s SAFM radio station today. SAA may have had an full-year loss of 1.5 billion rand ($182 million), Business Day reported, without saying where it got the information.\nThe Public Enterprises Ministry later appointed Vuyisile Kona, a former at the airline executive, as new chairman.\nIn Transparency International\u2019s 2011 Corruption Perceptions Index , where 0 is \u201chighly corrupt\u201d and 10 \u201cvery clean,\u201d Rwanda fared best among African nations with a score of 5, with war- ravaged Somalia ranking equal to North Korea at the very bottom.\nThe prevalence of cash over credit means revenue collection models also differ from those in established markets, with sales dependent on travel agents and online bookings requiring leeway for money transfers to be made days later, according to Peri.\nMobile Payments\nThat poses headaches for carriers such as FastJet, which may struggle to replicate the online sales strategy that backer Stelios Haji-Ioannou used at Britain\u2019s EasyJet Plc (EZJ) , Radixx says.\nFastJet CEO Ed Winter said in an interview that if prices are competitive Africans will find a way to pay, whether via agents, internet cafes or mobile banking, which he says has \u201creally taken off\u201d because of the lack of access to computers.\n\u201cThe other thing is that there\u2019s a fairly low expectation that the plane will be there, so people prefer to hand over bundles of cash at the airport when they can see it,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve won their confidence they\u2019ll be prepared to book.\u201d\nThe ultimate test of Africa\u2019s maturing aviation industry may be the success of otherwise of the continent\u2019s homegrown airlines in tapping the benefits of its economic expansion.\nWhile overseas trade has increased, foreign operators are ahead in \u201ccashing in\u201d on that growth, said Titus Naikuni, CEO of Kenya Airways (KNAL) , which is almost 27 percent owned by Air France-KLM and a member of the European company\u2019s SkyTeam global alliance. The carrier is sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s third-largest, after South African Air and Ethiopian Airlines Enterprise.\nStrongest Survive\nTewolde GebreMariam, CEO at Ethiopian, which has expanded its business through the ASKY Airlines venture in Togo, said in an e-mail that Africa is \u201cdominated\u201d by overseas entrants. The local share of international traffic has slipped to 18 percent from 22 percent in recent years, according to the carrier, a member of the Lufthansa-led Star Alliance since December.\nStill, weaker African airlines have mostly been eliminated, Tyler said, citing pan-national francophone carrier Air Afrique, which ceased flying in 2002, and Nigeria Airways, which failed a year later, and the survivors are more serious propositions.\n\u201cThe players left are pretty big, with pretty substantial government backing,\u201d the IATA chief said. \u201cIf they can manage themselves well and develop the right international partnerships then their prospects are good.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Alex Webb in Frankfurt at awebb25@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Chad Thomas at cthomas16@bloomberg.net\nAirlines Brave African Frontier as Growth Outweighs Graft Threat\nChris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg\nInternational Consolidated Airlines Group SA unit British Airways added flights to Liberia via Sierra Leone on Sept. 10, giving it 19 destinations in 16 Africa countries.\nInternational Consolidated Airlines Group SA unit British Airways added flights to Liberia via Sierra Leone on Sept. 10, giving it 19 destinations in 16 Africa countries.

The carriers were among dozens sued for allegedly fixing cargo prices by coordinating fuel surcharges worldwide. The settlements resolve claims from customers that used the airlines\u2019 freight services from 2000 through 2006.\n\u201cI find the agreements to be fair, reasonable and adequate to the class,\u201d Gleeson said in his order.\nBritish Airways agreed to pay $89.5 million while Santiago- based Lan and Brazilian partner Aerolinhas Brasileiras SA will pay a combined $66 million.

The small vehicles carry no company logos but are 9,000 pound ($14,000) copies of the current edition of the low-slung, squared off real thing produced by the Munich, Germany-based automaker.\nAdvertising is banned in Olympic stadiums and related venues. In London, sponsors, including those at the highest level who plow almost $1 billion into deals with the International Olympic Committee , are pushing the boundaries.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got no branding on it, it\u2019s got no Mini badge on it,\u201d BMW spokesman Graham Biggs said of the little cars. \u201cBut people like to recognize things and we\u2019ve had a fantastic reaction from people who see them in the stadium. The whole idea of Mini is it\u2019s a fun brand, the cars are cute and they have a smiley face.\u201d\nSimilar radio-controlled vehicles ferried discuses, shot puts, javelins and throwing hammers back to the start at the 2008 Games in Beijing. Those were bland blobs on tiny wheels, not copies of a beloved car first manufactured by the British Motor Corp. in the 1950s and \u201860s.\nBMW has had to be creative because, unlike soccer\u2019s World Cup and most other sports events, sponsors aren\u2019t allowed to advertise inside Olympic venues. Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter, the basic rules of the games, says \u201ccommercial installations and advertising signs shall not be allowed in the stadia.\u201d\nPeels Label\nSome athletes, including Michael Phelps , the U.S. swimmer who capped his career in London after winning a record 22 medals, have been seen to remove Coca-Cola Co. (KO) products placed in front of them by officials at the start of press conferences.\n\u201cWe recognize that people have commercial endorsements on the outside, though in a perfect world they\u2019d be a little more enlightened and recognize Coke\u2019s longstanding partnership and sponsorship of the Olympics,\u201d Joe Tripodi, chief marketing officer of Atlanta-based Coca Cola, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. \u201cShort term, I understand what they\u2019re doing. It disappoints us but it is what it is.\u201d\nWhen Phelps, who\u2019s not a Coke endorser, met the media after his final swim on Aug. 4, it was the first time he hadn\u2019t removed the bottles. He was even drinking from a bottle of Coke, after removing the label.\nLongtime Sponsor\nMark Adams , a spokesman for the Lausanne, Switzerland-based IOC, said Coke had been a sponsor of the games since 1928 and made its drinks available across Olympic sites, including press conferences.\n\u201cThis is consistent with previous Olympic games,\u201d he said. The IOC said its 11 top-tier sponsors paid $957 million since 2009 to attach the Olympic rings to their products worldwide.\nMcDonald\u2019s Corp. (MCD) , which pays $100 million over four years to be affiliated as a top partner of the Olympics, has seen some of the past restrictions relaxed. The world\u2019s largest restaurant chain was able to bring 200 children to the games and give them behind-the-scenes access to play beach volleyball at Horse Guards Parade and try archery at Lord\u2019s cricket ground. Getting the children there involved four years of talks about how McDonald\u2019s could get more for its money.\n\u2018More Value\u2019\n\u201cWe felt there was a lot more value we could add,\u201d Timo Lumme, the IOC\u2019s director of TV and marketing services, said according to the Sports Business Journal. \u201cWe try to dimensionalize the relationship beyond just being the basic sponsorship.\u201d\nLume didn\u2019t immediately return an e-mail sent through the IOC media office seeking comment on the sponsor relationship.\nWhile BMW and Coke are getting added exposure, luxury Swiss watchmaker Omega SA is taking advantage of its status as a \u201cWorldwide Olympic Partner\u201d with branded timing screens visible at every event. It even has its name on the bell that\u2019s rung to signal the final laps in races at the track, pool and velodrome.\n\u201cPeople are querying why Omega are so prominent and nobody else gets any branding,\u201d Nigel Currie, managing director of BrandRapport Ltd ., a marketing consultant, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a good question and nobody seems to know the answer.\u201d\nFor other companies -- even some which have paid to be part of the \u201cOlympic Family\u201d of athletes, Olympic officials, broadcast rights-holders and sponsors -- the restrictions are some of the most exacting around.\nHidden Candy\nKraft Foods Inc. (KFT) \u2019s Cadbury unit is an official \u201csupporter\u201d of this year\u2019s games, yet its candy bars are kept in closed boxes and aren\u2019t allowed to be on show at food outlets around the stadium.\nMichael Payne, the IOC\u2019s first marketing and broadcast- rights director from 1983 to 2004, said London\u2019s Olympic Park is the \u201ccleanest\u201d he\u2019s seen as far as ads go.\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen overall it\u2019s as well or better controlled than previous games,\u201d Payne said in an interview.\nProduct suppliers not on the roster of Olympic sponsors have to go even further to hide their identities. The jars of pickles and eggs steeped in vinegar at fish-and-chip stalls in the Olympic Park had their labels removed, and bags of potato chips are sold in plain silver packs.\n\u2018Money-Making Machine\u2019\n\u201cEven though we see the best sports in the world, it\u2019s still a money making machine,\u201d said Ian Richards , a 42-year-old Briton, while buying two bottles of Heineken beer from a vendor manning an unmarked trough inside the Olympic Park, the main group of venues. \u201cUnfortunately it\u2019s a capitalist society. You pay your money, you get to display.\u201d\nBMW also provides cars to carry athletes to their medal ceremonies and has a fleet of full-size Minis that take athletes\u2019 samples to the central doping control lab, Biggs said.\nThe sponsorship at the London Games is through agreement with local organizers and is provided by BMW U.K., which has decided not to bid to be automotive partner to the games in Rio in 2016, Biggs said.\nOrganizers had no problem with the marketing potential of using the car\u2019s design for the field vehicles, according to Biggs.\n\u201cThey could see how visually interesting it would be,\u201d he said.\nEnlarge image\nMiniature Minis Lugging Javelins Bring Scrutiny of Olympic Ads\nThe Mini MINI electric car, specifically designed for transporting sports equipment across the field of play during the London Olympics.

Now we expect a second half with rising demand for our railroad because of production and freight prices that will rebound to last year\u2019s levels.\u201d\nThe value of Brazil\u2019s corn exports almost quintupled in July from a year earlier to $423 million, the Trade Ministry said in a press release in Aug. 1.\n\u2018Big Surge\u2019\n\u201cWe are seeing a big surge in corn exports now, basically because of the U.S. situation,\u201d Tatiana Prazeres, Brazil\u2019s foreign trade secretary, said in an interview in Brasilia. \u201cThis usually happens in August, but this year it happened in July.\u201d\nThe U.S. drought, which hit hardest during a critical time for developing corn and soybean plants, has pushed up prices as potential yields and quality have fallen. At least 48 percent of U.S. corn and 37 percent of soybeans were rated as poor or very poor as of July 29, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\nALL\u2019s recent share surge gives it price-to-earnings ratio of 29.6, the most expensive among global peers after Australia \u2019s QR National Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nRisky Stock\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that ALL is expensive, even if it is a little over our target,\u201d Felipe Vinagre, an analyst at Barclays Plc, said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. \u201cWhat isn\u2019t favorable is the return-to-risk ratio because there are lots of risks involved, especially regulation in the short term.\u201d\nThe railroad operator also stands to benefit as soybean output surges, BB Investimentos\u2019 Nitta said. Farmers are set to harvest a record soybean crop of as much as 83 million tons in the 2012-13 season, which would propel Brazil past the U.S. as the world\u2019s biggest producer of the oilseed, Sao Paulo-based consulting firm Agroconsult said in a July 13 report.\nALL is ready to handle the increased shipments after it invested 700 million reais since 2009 to expand capacity at its railroads in Mato Grosso state, Campos said.\n\u201cWe are prepared to grow an average of 10 percent in the next five years,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s just hope that the forecast for good crop output next season becomes a reality.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Mario Sergio Lima in Brasilia at mlima11@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jessica Brice at jbrice1@bloomberg.net ; James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net\nALL Gains on Corn Shipments Amid U.S. Drought: Corporate Brazil\nVictor J.

(NKE) , Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) and Trek Bicycle Corp. after USADA published evidence from 11 former teammates on Oct. 10 that the 41-year-old \u201cengaged in serial cheating\u201d in winning seven straight Tour de France titles through 2005. Today, sunglass maker Oakley said it was ending its relationship with the rider.\nThe Texan last week also stepped down as chairman of Livestrong, the cancer foundation he founded. Tim Herman, Armstrong\u2019s attorney, didn\u2019t immediately return an e-mail seeking comment on the cycling union\u2019s decision.\n\u201cI was sickened by what I read\u201d in the USADA report, McQuaid told reporters, adding he was particularly struck by how Armstrong\u2019s former teammate David Zabriskie testified he was \u201ccoerced\u201d into doping by team officials.\nUSADA Chief Executive Officer Travis Tygart said in an e- mailed statement the cycling authority \u201chas made the credible decision available to it.\u201d The UCI could have appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\nUCI executives will meet on Oct. 26 to decide whether to recover prize money won by Armstrong, and whether to award his titles to anyone else, McQuaid said. They will discuss the possibility of forming a panel to explore past doping based on South Africa\u2019s \u201cTruth and Reconciliation\u201d commission that reviewed apartheid, UCI lawyer Philippe Verbiest said.\n1970s\nMcQuaid said doping in cycling dates back to at least the 1970s when he was aware of it as an amateur rider.\nThe other Tour winners to lose titles for doping were Floyd Landis in 2006 and Alberto Contador in 2010. Twenty of the 21 riders to finish in the top three from 1999 to 2005 -- the years Armstrong won -- have been \u201ctied to likely doping\u201d through admissions, sanctions, public investigations or exceeding the UCI\u2019s hematocrit level, USADA said.\nArmstrong has denied doping for more than a decade.\nUSADA said on Aug. 24 it was stripping him of his titles after he refused to fight the group\u2019s charges at an arbitration hearing. Herman, Armstrong\u2019s lawyer, on Oct. 10 described the USADA\u2019s evidence as \u201ca taxpayer-funded tabloid piece rehashing old, disproved, unreliable allegations based largely on axe- grinders, serial perjurers, coerced testimony, sweetheart deals and threat-induced stories.\u201d\nDoping Fallout\nIn other fallout from the USADA report, Dutch lender Rabobank Groep said last week it would pull its 15 million euros of annual spending on pro cycling.\nArmstrong\u2019s former teammate Levi Leipheimer was fired by the Omega Pharma - Quick Step team after admitting doping in an affidavit to USADA. Johan Bruyneel exited as manager of the RadioShack team. The Belgian, who oversaw Armstrong\u2019s seven Tour wins, denies wrongdoing.\n\u201cThis is the biggest crisis cycling has ever faced,\u201d McQuaid said. \u201cMy message to cycling, to our riders, to our sponsors and to our fans today is: Cycling has a future.\u201d\nLuxottica Group SpA\u2019s (LUX) Oakley unit today became the latest company to drop Armstrong as an endorser. The International Olympic Committee said it will wait for more information before deciding what to do about a bronze medal Armstrong won at the 2000 Sydney games.\nBreaking Omerta?\nAsked why Armstrong\u2019s doping hadn\u2019t been caught, McQuaid said the UCI had limited powers to uncover what he called the \u201csophisticated\u201d doping regime.\n\u201cThe UCI doesn\u2019t have police powers,\u201d McQuaid said, adding it had to rely on drug testing. He said it was \u201cabsolutely untrue\u201d that the organization had covered up failed tests by Armstrong.\nUSADA CEO Tygart said that an independent \u201cTruth and Reconciliation\u201d commission would allow cycling to \u201cunshackle\u201d itself from the past.\n\u201cThere are many more details of doping that are hidden, many more doping doctors and corrupt team directors and the \u2018omerta\u2019 has not yet been fully broken,\u201d Tygart said.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Alex Duff in Madrid  at aduff4@bloomberg.net Giles Broom in Geneva at gbroom@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Christopher Elser at  at celser@bloomberg.net\nInternational Cycling Union head Pat McQuaid\nFabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images\nInternational Cycling Union head Pat McQuaid said today at a press conference in Switzerland, \u201cLance Armstrong has no place in cycling.\u201d\nInternational Cycling Union head Pat McQuaid said today at a press conference in Switzerland, \u201cLance Armstrong has no place in cycling.\u201d Photographer: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:45:18", "post_time": "2012-10-22 11:00:10", "author": "Alex Duff , Giles Broom", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-22/armstrong-stripped-of-tour-de-france-titles-by-governing-body.html", "title": "Armstrong Is Stripped of Tour de France Titles by Cycling Body", "post_date": "2012-10-22", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "52b9d9d5206b143feafaa95b87550e9b0ab34cef"}, {"content": "Big Brewers Chase U.S. Cider Growth on Craft Beer Explosion\nBy Clementine Fletcher - 2012-10-21T23:01:00Z\nTy Wright/Bloomberg\nRalph Hugus, owner of Hugus Fruit Farm, loads crates of apples onto a trailer to be brought back for processing at the farm's facility in Rushville, Ohio, on Sept. 11, 2012.\nWith ciders returning to U.S. shelves, big brewers need to keep newfound consumers keen on the fizzy, alcoholic apple drink to counter a slowdown in the U.K.\nHeineken NV (HEIA) , Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) and Carlsberg A/S (CARLA) are all investing in cider as drinkers seeking an alternative to beer boosted U.S. volumes 20 percent last year, contrasting with a 2 percent decline in beer, according to Euromonitor International. Cider acquisitions are still small compared with the prices paid by brewers for beermakers, including a $20.1 billion bid by AB InBev for control of Corona\u2019s maker, while tapping into a market ripe for expansion.\nCraft beers have paved the way for more expensive, niche brands in the U.S., the world\u2019s second-biggest beer market, even as growth of established names like Bud Light and Coors stalls. Moreover, the sweeter taste of cider, with a similar alcohol level to beer, may appeal to women and drinkers seeking novelty.\n\u201cCider\u2019s a growth story because of the demographics --it\u2019s sweet, it\u2019s natural, it appeals to the Coke generation,\u201d Stephen Glancey, chief executive officer of Dublin-based C&C Group Plc, which sells two of the world\u2019s biggest brands in Magners and Gaymers, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s unisex beer.\u201d\nCraft beer\u2019s success is good for the total beer category, Carlsberg\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Joergen Buhl Rasmussen said in an Oct. 12 interview with Bloomberg. The company is creating more products for women, he said, suggesting sweeter brews and ciders may help win sales.\nU.S. Boom\nC&C paid about 20 million euros ($26 million) for U.S. brand Hornsby\u2019s last year and MillerCoors LLC, the U.S. joint venture between SABMiller Plc and Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP) , bought Crispin Cider Co. in February for an undisclosed sum. The Irish company is set to report first-half results tomorrow, and analysts at Davy in Dublin estimate volume growth of as much as 30 percent in the U.S., excluding Hornsby\u2019s.\n\u201cThe potential for growth in cider outside traditional markets is significant,\u201d Barry Gallagher, a Davy analyst, wrote in the note dated Oct. 19.\nThe interest comes as the U.K., the world\u2019s biggest cider market, sees appetite for the drink expand even as the beer market declines, weighed down by tough economic conditions as well as a consumer shift to wine and spirits. Volumes are starting to slow though, according to Euromonitor, and analysts at Societe Generale SA expect stagnant medium-term growth. The U.K. represents about half of the cider category, they estimate.\nCider on Ice\nCider grew at a 10 percent compound annual growth rate between 2005 and 2009 in the U.K., SocGen said. C&C (GCC) \u2019s introduction of Magners in 2006 revitalized the category by creating the trend of serving cider over ice, said Spiros Malandrakis of Euromonitor. The addition of new flavors -- such as pear cider -- have also helped keep drinkers interested.\n\u201cIf there was no innovation, there\u2019d be no cider,\u201d Malandrakis said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t constantly innovate, the category is dead.\u201d The seasonal nature of cider, which traditionally sells more in summer than winter, may drive a push into different flavors or food pairing.\nThe trend toward premium and niche variants has helped reshape cider\u2019s reputation in the U.K. away from connotations of being an inexpensive, relatively strong alcoholic drink toward a more sophisticated tipple.\nPremium Push\n\u201cCider is leaving behind the cheap tramp juice association,\u201d Malandrakis said. \u201cIt\u2019s been consistently and straightforwardly moving in the premium direction.\u201d\nCider sales are estimated to rise at 10.6 percent CAGR by volume in 2011 through 2016, according to Euromonitor, while U.K. rates slow to 5.2 percent. Cider\u2019s countryside image of being niche, local and authentic may help the drink grow on both sides of the Atlantic, and at higher prices, C&C said. Still, cider represents only 0.2 percent of the U.S. beer market, Davy analysts estimate.\nAs C&C and SABMiller (SAB) buy into the U.S., other heavyweight brewing players are unveiling brands to the market. Anheuser- Busch, the world\u2019s biggest brewer, followed the introduction of premium-priced Stella Artois Cidre in the U.K. last year with low-calorie Michelob Ultra Light Cider in the U.S. in May. Boston Beer Co. (SAM) also rolled out its Angry Orchard apple drink across the U.S. at the end of the first quarter.\nStrongbow Sales\nHeineken said Aug. 15 that it\u2019ll take over distribution of Strongbow, the second-biggest brand in the U.S., from the Vermont Hard Cider Co., owner of market leader Woodchuck.\n\u201cCider\u2019s an early trend\u201d in the U.S., where categories aren\u2019t built \u201covernight,\u201d Heineken Chief Executive Officer Jean-Francois van Boxmeer said in August.\n\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on Strongbow as a global cider brand and are going to push it in the U.S. further,\u201d he said. The Dutch brewer bought Belgium \u2019s Stassen SA in June to gain research and development facilities.\nConsumers prefer small, local brands to big names that \u201ctry to be all things to all markets,\u201d counters C&C\u2019s Glancey.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve had outside players and big guys coming into the category,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some very good and some very bad ciders made in the next few years.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Clementine Fletcher in London at cfletcher5@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Celeste Perri at cperri@bloomberg.net\nBig Brewers Chase U.S. Cider Growth on Craft Beer Explosion\nTy Wright/Bloomberg\nCrates of apples wait to be loaded for local delivery at Hugus Fruit Farm in Rushville, Ohio, on Sept. 11, 2012.\nCrates of apples wait to be loaded for local delivery at Hugus Fruit Farm in Rushville, Ohio, on Sept. 11, 2012.

The International Olympic Committee and top officials of the Tour de France have said they would wait for the federation to act before deciding what to do with Armstrong\u2019s results. The American cyclist won a bronze medal in the road time trial at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.\nUSADA, based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, said on Oct. 10 that Armstrong, a 41-year-old Texan, was a \u201cserial cheat\u201d who used banned drugs and forced teammates on the U.S. Postal Service team and other squads to do likewise.\nIt said the actions started before and lasted beyond the period when Armstrong won the Tour, cycling\u2019s most prestigious race, from 1999 through 2006. USADA stripped him of those titles and banned him from all Olympic-related sports.\n\u201cThe evidence shows beyond any doubt that the U.S. Postal Service Pro Cycling Team ran the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen,\u201d USADA said in a statement the day the report was released.\nWeighted Process\nArmstrong has consistently denied using banned substances and has said he never failed a drug test. He declined to take USADA\u2019s findings to arbitration, saying the process was weighted overwhelmingly against him.\nArmstrong stepped down two days ago as chairman of Livestrong, the foundation he started to help people live with cancer. The retired cyclist won his Tour titles after surviving testicular cancer that spread to his head and lungs.\nMinutes after he resigned as foundation head, Armstrong was dropped as an endorser by Nike Inc. (NKE) , which said it could no longer support him because of the \u201cseemingly insurmountable evidence\u201d of his drug use and cover-up. It had sponsored Armstrong since 1996.\nOther sponsors, including Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) , quickly followed in dropping Armstrong while saying they would continue to support the Livestrong foundation.\u2019\u2019\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Larry Siddons in New York at lsiddons@bloomberg.net .\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Sillup at msillup@bloomberg.net .\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:45:21", "post_time": "2012-10-19 13:06:43", "author": "Larry Siddons", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-19/cycling-body-to-rule-on-lance-armstrong-doping-findings-oct-22.html", "title": "Cycling Body to Rule on Lance Armstrong Doping Findings Oct. 22", "post_date": "2012-10-19", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "91a30166cadc1c8bf74defe83fb95304008fb4f3"}, {"content": "Rabobank Drops Cycling Sponsorship on U.S. Doping Scandal\nBy Alex Duff - 2012-10-19T14:29:53Z\nRabobank Groep, the biggest Dutch mortgage lender, will end its 17-year sponsorship of professional cycling after its team was linked to the doping scandal involving Lance Armstrong .\nRabobank has lost confidence in pro cycling following a report by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency last week, board member Bert Bruggink said on the bank\u2019s website. The report, which described widespread cheating, said American rider Levi Leipheimer doped when on the Rabobank team in 2003. Current team rider Carlos Barredo of Spain was suspended yesterday pending an investigation of his blood profiles.\nThe company is among the biggest sponsors of professional cycling, spending as much as 15 million euros ($19.6 million) on the sport last year. Its women\u2019s team includes Olympic road-race champion Marianne Vos of the Netherlands. Rabobank will withdraw its name from its men\u2019s and women\u2019s pro teams on Dec. 31, although it will fund them for one more year through a foundation, Bruggink told reporters.\n\u201cWe are now longer convinced that the international professional world of cycling can make this a clean and fair sport,\u201d Bruggink said. \u201cWe are not confident that this will change for the better in the foreseeable future.\u201d He said it was a \u201cpainful\u201d decision because it affects fans and cyclists who aren\u2019t deserving of blame.\nThis week, Nike Inc.

Thailand, with a population of about 67 million, is one of the few Southeast Asian nations where the Copenhagen-based brewer has a negligible footprint . The joint venture with the maker of Leo beer gives Carlsberg a partner that controls almost 60 percent of the country\u2019s beer market.\nHeineken got approval to take control of Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd. (APB) on Sept. 28 after buying out its venture partner for S$5.6 billion ($4.6 billion), giving it full ownership of operations across Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. It was the culmination of a two-month tussle with Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi , who offered to buy Singapore\u2019s Fraser & Neave Ltd., the owner of a 40 percent stake in APB.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking for high growth, Thailand and China are two very crucial markets,\u201d Gerard Rijk , an analyst at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam, said in a telephone interview.\nThailand and China, the biggest beer market by volume, will be the leading areas for growth, Rijk said. Carlsberg operates in China through a venture with Chongqing Brewery Co., of which it owns about 30 percent. Retail beer sales in Thailand may reach $3.52 billion, compared with $36 billion in China, according to market researcher Mintel International.\nThai Settlement\nHeineken said last week it wants to benefit from expansion in the \u201cinternational premium segment\u201d in Asia , which encompasses higher-priced Carlsberg and Heineken brands.\nThe Danish brewer, which also sells brands including Tuborg and Kronenbourg 1664, has stumbled in Thailand before. A joint venture formed in 2000 with Chang Beverages Pte, owned by Charoen, failed to develop as planned and led to Carlsberg removing executives representing Charoen from the board of Carlsberg Asia in 2003.\nCarlsberg said at the time it was \u201cnot happy with the value\u201d of assets Chang wanted to add to the joint venture. The dispute ended in 2005 with Carlsberg paying $120 million to divide their assets and settle a legal dispute.\nCharoen, 68, controls Singapore-traded Thai Beverage Pcl (THBEV) , one of the companies that spurred Heineken to offer to buy out its partner F&N from APB.\nSingha and Leo\nCompanies owned by Charoen began buying shares in F&N and APB in July, threatening Heineken\u2019s control over APB and sparking a bidding war. Heineken finally increased its bid to S$53 a share from S$50 to win backing for its APB bid. APB traded at S$34.69 on July 16 before the process began.\nWith Singha, Carlsberg gets a partner with 59 percent of the Thai beer market in 2011, compared with the 31 percent share of Charoen\u2019s ThaiBev, according to data from Euromonitor International. Singha, founded by its parent company Boon Rawd Brewery Co. in 1933 , already has three breweries as well as water and soft-drink production sites.\nSingha and Carlsberg said the partnership will allow them to \u201cstrengthen the premium portfolio in Thailand.\u201d The Thai brewer sells Singha beer as well as Leo, the biggest brand in the country, and both brands have been gaining market share compared with ThaiBev\u2019s Chang since 2006.\nCarlsberg, which also said it could expand Singha sales outside Thailand, will compete with Heineken (HEIA) , which had a 4.3 percent brand share in the country last year in the international premium segment.\nSeeking Growth\n\u201cThe deal gives Carlsberg a good foothold in the Thai market and fits with the company\u2019s strategy to exploit growth options in the Asian markets,\u201d Mikkel Petersen, senior equity adviser at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen, wrote today. \u201cIf Carlsberg plays its cards right in Asia, the shares may have additional growth potential.\u201d\nHeineken rose 0.8 percent to 46.77 euros at 11:24 a.m. in Amsterdam trading, extending this year\u2019s gain to 31 percent. Carlsberg advanced 1.5 percent to 521.5 kroner in Copenhagen, bringing the year\u2019s increase to 29 percent.\nCompetition could benefit both companies, Rijk said, as more brewers in the market make it easier to promote a growing genre of beer to consumers.\nHeineken and Carlsberg, as well as beermakers such as SABMiller Plc and Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) , are trying to offset sluggish growth in Europe with emerging-market sales.\nThailand\u2019s Finance Ministry forecasts economic growth will reach 5.5 percent this year, while Europe continues to grapple with a financial crisis.\n\u2018Key Platform\u2019\nCarlsberg reported net revenue of 63.6 billion kroner ($11 billion) in 2011, a 6 percent increase excluding acquisitions, disposals and currency fluctuations. Revenue at its Asia unit rose 15 percent on the same basis to 6.8 billion kroner, and it said it would invest in capacity expansion as it sees the region as a \u201ckey platform for growth.\u201d\nCarlsberg has trailed Kirin Holdings Co., Asahi Group Holdings Co. and Heineken in deals in emerging markets , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nWhile the Singha partnership gives it access to a fast- growing region, it doesn\u2019t fully control the business, increasing the risk, Rijk said.\n\u201cThe Singha tie-up is a good move, but joint ventures could be less successful if not executed well,\u201d Rijk said. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk you lose attention from your partner on the ground, perhaps when a bigger competitor comes in.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Clementine Fletcher in London at cfletcher5@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Celeste Perri at cperri@bloomberg.net ; Lars Klemming at lklemming@bloomberg.net\nHeineken to Gain Control of Asian Brewer as F&N Votes for Deal\nTomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg\nCans of Heineken NV beer and Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd.'s Tiger beer in Tokyo.\nCans of Heineken NV beer and Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd.'s Tiger beer in Tokyo.

It\u2019s providing training and identity-checking devices to bartenders to counter underage drinking, and AB InBev also expanded the parental responsibility campaign to China , the world\u2019s biggest beer market.\nAB InBev set six \u201c responsible drinking goals \u201d in 2011 to be implemented globally by 2014. The brewer said it\u2019s on pace to reach at least 100 million adults with programs to help them discuss alcohol consumption with their kids, and it spent almost $55 million in 2011 in advertising responsible drinking. It plans to spend at least $300 million in the three years through 2014.\nChief Executive Officer Carlos Brito is scheduled to join staff from AB InBev tomorrow in its third annual beer responsibility day, including an event in New York \u2019s Times Square where employees will approach adults asking them to pledge to drink responsibly.\nAB InBev is the world\u2019s largest beermaker and sells brands including Bud Lite and Beck\u2019s. It reported revenue of $39.3 billion last year, and sold a total of 399.4 million hectoliters of beverages globally. It agreed to expand its business by buying full control of Mexico \u2019s Grupo Modelo SAB, the maker of Corona beer, in June for $20.2 billion.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Clementine Fletcher in London cfletcher5@bloomberg.net .\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Celeste Perri at cperri@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:45:30", "post_time": "2012-09-20 09:26:03", "author": "Clementine Fletcher", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-20/ab-inbev-targets-parents-bartenders-in-new-responsibility-push.html", "title": "AB InBev Targets Parents, Bartenders in Responsibility Push", "post_date": "2012-09-20", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "5294ef164060357d0627105bbbbfdba07d062941"}, {"content": "European Stocks Decline for Second Day; Akzo Nobel Falls\nBy Peter Levring - 2012-09-18T16:00:14Z\nEuropean stocks declined the most in two weeks as investors bet that the rally in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) to a 15-month high overshot the economic outlook and prospects for corporate earnings.\nAkzo Nobel NV (AKZA) , the world\u2019s largest paintmaker, tumbled the most in one year after saying Chief Executive Officer Ton Beuchner will go on sick leave.

(FNN) rose above Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi\u2019s offer price as investors speculated that the Singapore-based company may attract a higher bid and Heineken NV (HEIA) considered its next step in a two-month battle to gain control of F&N\u2019s beer business.\nF&N advanced 4.8 percent to S$8.92 at the close of trading in Singapore yesterday after a company linked to Charoen\u2019s Thai Beverage Pcl (THBEV) offered S$8.88 a share for the 70 percent of the company that he doesn\u2019t control. The bid, which potentially blocks Heineken from buying Tiger beer maker Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd. (APB) , values the company at $10.3 billion. F&N rose in Singapore trading today.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a prospect that someone can come in with a better offer,\u201d Justin Harper, a Singapore-based market strategist at IG Markets, said in a phone interview. \u201cThere\u2019s also the prospect that if Charoen takes over F&N they will unlock a lot more value by breaking the company up.\u201d\nCharoen, 68, set off a scramble for F&N and its assets when he agreed to buy a stake in July. Heineken countered with a bid for F&N\u2019s 40 percent stake in APB, which the Dutch brewer already partially owns. Charoen hasn\u2019t explained the rationale behind his offer, which comes ahead of a Sept. 28 meeting where F&N shareholders will vote on Heineken\u2019s proposal.\n\u201cThai Bev\u2019s plans for FNN if it manages to buy out a majority stake remains unclear,\u201d Jenai Chua, a Singapore-based analyst at Bank Julius Baer & Co., which manages $281 billion in assets, said by e-mail. \u201cWe would not rule out the possibility that it is trying to block the sale of APB to Heineken.\u201d\nF&N advanced 0.6 percent to $8.970 at 9:37 a.m. in Singapore trading, boosting its climb this year to 45 percent.\nF&N Counter Offer?\nHeineken\u2019s options may include making a counter offer for F&N, either by itself or with a partner, said Goh Han Peng, an analyst at DMG & Partners Research Pte in Singapore.\nWere Heineken to make such a bid, the main risk would be finding a buyer for F&N\u2019s property business amid a difficult economic climate, Melissa Earlam , an analyst at UBS AG, wrote in a note. Without a partner, \u201cwe believe Heineken\u2019s balance sheet would be too stretched to counter-bid,\u201d she said.\nJapan \u2019s Kirin Holdings Co., which also owns a 15 percent stake in F&N, had considered making a bid for F&N\u2019s food and soft-drinks unit, several people with knowledge of the matter said in August. Coca-Cola Co. has explored a bid for the drinks operations, people with knowledge of the matter have said.\nHeineken, which owns 46.3 percent of APB, won\u2019t walk away from the deal as the Amsterdam-based brewer wouldn\u2019t be able to realize its ambition of becoming a global brewer, Goh said.\n\u201cGiving up is out of the question,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cIf Heineken makes an offer with another party, the possibility of a break-up is higher.\u201d\nEmerging Markets\nThe Dutch company, the world\u2019s third-largest brewer, has sought full control over APB to protect its hold over a key emerging-markets business. Heineken has the smallest presence of the world\u2019s big three brewers in developing regions such as Asia and Latin America , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nHeineken in August raised its offer for APB to S$53 a share from S$50 and said it won\u2019t increase the bid. The $4.4 billion offer followed a S$55-a-share bid from a company controlled by Charoen\u2019s son-in-law for a 7.3 percent stake.\nYesterday\u2019s offer for F&N \u201cmakes it even more unclear how Heineken can ever gain control of the APB asset,\u201d Earlam said.\nF&N said in a Sept. 12 presentation to investors that Heineken\u2019s offer for APB is \u201chigher than the corresponding multiples for recent precedent transactions.\u201d\nBid Multiple\nInvestors may balk at any increase in the price to gain control of APB, Earlam said. The multiple, valuing APB at about 21.5 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization \u201cset a new record in terms of major brewing M&A,\u201d Earlam said. Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s bid for control of Grupo Modelo SAB was at 17 times, she estimated.\nHeineken will review ThaiBev\u2019s statement and comment when appropriate, spokesman John Clarke said in an e-mail.\nHeineken rose 0.2 percent to 43.03 euros at the close of trading in Amsterdam yesterday. ThaiBev rose as much as 1.5 percent to 34.5 Singapore cents.\nThe bid battle is likely to be a straight fight between Heineken and ThaiBev, Julius Baer\u2019s Chua said.\n\u201cGiven the advanced stage that the bidding war has progressed to, any interested parties would already have made their intentions known,\u201d he said.\nPurchasing F&N would widen Charoen\u2019s influence in Asia. His brewer, which is F&N\u2019s largest shareholder with a 29 percent stake, got almost all its revenue from Thailand in 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nWhile the billionaire\u2019s bid is the largest announced by a Thai company in at least a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, he may still need to increase the price.\n\u201cThe price is not convincing,\u201d Donald Chua, an analyst at CIMB-GK Pte in Singapore , said in a note, adding that the potential for higher offers from ThaiBev will act as a catalyst to F&N shares. \u201cWe advocate waiting for further developments.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Clementine Fletcher in London at cfletcher5@bloomberg.net ; Jonathan Burgos in Singapore at jburgos4@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Stephanie Wong at swong139@bloomberg.net\nF&N Climbs Above Billionaire\u2019s Offer as Heineken Mulls Next Move\nTomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg\nTiger beer, produced by Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd.

That was less than the 0.77-real per-share median estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\nBradesco, led by Chief Executive Officer Luiz Carlos Trabuco Cappi, 61, set aside 3.3 billion reais to cover loan losses in the third quarter, down from 3.41 billion reais in the previous three months and up from 2.78 billion reais a year earlier. The bank has been slowing credit growth this year as delinquencies for consumer loans in Brazil increase.\n\u201cAlthough operating trends were positive, net income was 5.7 percent below our estimate on lower trading gains and lower- than-expected reduction in loan-loss provisions,\u201d Banco Itau BBA SA analysts including Regina Longo Sanchez wrote in a note to clients today. \u201cLoan growth was weaker than expected, at 1.9 percent quarter over quarter, versus our estimate of 3.8 percent.\u201d\nBradesco declined 0.5 percent to 32.19 reais at 12:24 p.m. in Sao Paulo , compared with a gain of 0.2 percent for Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) , Latin America\u2019s largest bank. The Bovespa benchmark index rose 0.3 percent.\nLate Payments\nThe delinquency rate for debt overdue more than 90 days was 4.1 percent at the end of September, after reaching 4.2 percent in the second quarter and 3.8 percent in the third quarter of last year. The bank expects the rate to continue improving as central bank reduces benchmark interest rates and the country\u2019s economy recovers, Luiz Carlos Angelotti, an executive director at Bradesco, told reporters on a conference call today.\nBrazil\u2019s central bank cut the Selic rate by 525 basis points since August 2011 to a record 7.25 percent this year to revive the economy.\n\u201cThe worst of the credit-delinquency cycle has passed for Bradesco,\u201d Eduardo Nishio, an analyst at Brasil Plural Corretora de Cambio, Titulos e Valores Mobiliarios SA, wrote in a note to clients on Oct. 1. The Sao Paulo-based brokerage has an overweight rating on Bradesco.\nLoan Growth\nThe loan book increased 12 percent to 371.7 billion reais in the third quarter from a year earlier, after expanding 14 percent in the previous quarter and 22 percent a year earlier. In June, the bank reduced its forecast for lending growth in 2012 to a range of 14 percent to 18 percent, down from 18 percent to 22 percent. Total assets reached 856.3 billion reais in the third quarter, up almost 19 percent from a year earlier.\n\u201cBradesco\u2019s loan book will probably grow at the lower range of the guidance,\u201d Angelotti said today, adding lending will expand at a faster pace in the fourth quarter as Brazil \u2019s economy recovers.\nBradesco and Itau slowed credit growth as delinquencies for consumer loans in Brazil rose to 7.9 percent in May, a 30-month high. The rate remained at the same level in July and August, according to the central bank.\nItau cut its guidance for lending growth in 2012 as it reduces its auto-loan portfolio. The total loan book, including vehicles, will expand about 10 percent this year, Rogerio Calderon, the head of investor relations , said in July. In February, the bank said it expected credit to grow 14 percent to 17 percent.\nFederally controlled Banco do Brasil SA , based in Brasilia, expanded credit 20 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier as it cut borrowing costs under pressure from Brazil President Dilma Rousseff .\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Francisco Marcelino in Sao Paulo at mdeoliveira@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Scheer at dscheer@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:45:43", "post_time": "2012-10-22 10:54:40", "author": "Francisco Marcelino", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-22/bradesco-third-quarter-net-misses-estimates-on-higher-provisions.html", "title": "Bradesco Profit Misses Analysts\u2019 Estimates on Provisions", "post_date": "2012-10-22", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "3579158458d87721bfe52282884b3e87528132d0"}, {"content": "Gafisa Gains 70% as Builders\u2019 Cash Crunch Ebbs: Corporate Brazil\nBy Katerina Petroff and Denyse Godoy - 2012-09-18T20:41:15Z\nGafisa SA (GFSA3) , Brazil \u2019s sixth-biggest homebuilder by revenue, is on track to post a record quarterly gain, leading an industry rebound driven by more deliveries of apartments and offices and fewer new projects as growth wanes.\nGafisa has climbed 70 percent this quarter, making it the third-best performing stock on the Bovespa index. PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes (PDGR3) , Brazil\u2019s biggest homebuilder, and Brookfield Incorporacoes SA (BISA3) also are rallying. Four (IBOV) of the 10 worst performers in the first half of the year were real- estate shares.\nLast year\u2019s glut of new projects at a time of fewer deliveries drained cash from Brazilian homebuilders, prompting companies from Brookfield to PDG to unveil plans to raise capital. Gafisa surged 15 percent on Aug. 10 when it posted a second-quarter profit that topped analyst estimates after the company shifted its strategy to focus on more expensive properties as the expansion in Latin America \u2019s biggest economy slowed to 0.4 percent from 0.56 percent a year earlier.\n\u201cSeveral contractors halted construction of projects because of cash-flow problems\u201d after the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, said Jose Luiz Garcia, who helps manage 3.1 billion reais ($1.5 billion) of assets at Rio de Janeiro- based investment fund Mercatto Gestao de Recursos. \u201cThere\u2019s potential for the sector to recover its status and show good growth.\u201d\nGafisa fell 2.4 percent to 4.48 reais at the close of trading in Sao Paulo today, while PDG Realty rose 4.1 percent to 4.07 reais and Brookfield climbed 1.7 percent to 4.14 reais.\nSurprising Analysts\nGafisa said Aug. 10 it had a profit of 1.05 million reais in the second quarter, surprising analysts who had forecast a third consecutive quarterly loss. The company in the period focused less on its low-income housing unit, Tenda, where cost overruns and home-sale cancellations after preapproved buyers failed to get subsidized mortgages contributed to a 1.03 billion-real loss in the fourth quarter.\n\u201cIt seems the worst is over for Gafisa,\u201d Erick Hood, an analyst at brokerage SLW Corretora, said in a Sept. 10 telephone interview. \u201cThe market now sees a trend for better results and cash-flow generation.\u201d\nDemand for mortgages has surged as the central bank cut interest rates and the government increased subsidies for first- time home buyers. Outstanding mortgages rose 40 percent in the past 12 months through July, according to the central bank.\nExpensive Stock\nGafisa, based in Sao Paulo, has become the most expensive stock on the Bovespa index with shares trading at 189 times estimated 2012 earnings. Rio de Janeiro-based Brookfield trades at 22 times, while Sao Paulo-based Cyrela Brazil Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes (CYRE3) trades at 9.7. Rossi is the cheapest homebuilder with a ratio of 5.1, compared with an average of 20 for all companies on the Bovespa index.\nRecent gains among homebuilders probably are connected to the overall rebound in Brazilian equities rather than renewed confidence in the industry, said Marcos Paulo Fernandes, an analyst at brokerage Votorantim Corretora. The Bovespa index is up 14 percent this quarter. The benchmark fell 0.5 percent yesterday to 61,805.98, and closed little changed today.\nRecovering Profits\n\u201cEven though homebuilders are taking action to resolve the problems they faced in recent quarters, they can\u2019t guarantee they are going to recover profitability,\u201d Fernandes said by telephone from Sao Paulo . Fernandes said he has a buy rating on Gafisa, PDG and Belo Horizonte, Brazil-based MRV  Engenharia e Participacoes SA because of the steps they are taking to reverse losses.\nGafisa, PDG and Rossi press offices didn\u2019t respond to phone calls for comments. Brookfield Chief Financial Officer Cristiano Machado said recent measures should be sufficient to help it return to a profit and reduce uncertainty.\n\u201cWhen announcing the second quarter results, we cut launchings guidance and disclosed plans for a capital increase, so the market could understand better the company\u2019s strategy,\u201d Machado said in a phone interview yesterday. \u201cThat clarification helped Brookfield to recover investors\u2019 confidence.\u201d\nGafisa said Sept. 10 it may sell a stake in its Alphaville unit, while Rossi said Sept. 5 it\u2019s planning a 500 million-real capital increase through a private placement. Brookfield approved a capital increase of 400 million reais through a private placement, according to a regulatory filing on Aug 15.\nBrookfield approved a capital increase of 400 million reais selling as much as 130 million shares at 3.06 reais each in a private placement, according to a statement today. Shares fell as much as 6.4 percent to 3.81 reais in the steepest intraday decline since Aug. 14.\nHome Prices\nGafisa announced 61 percent fewer new projects in the second quarter compared with a year earlier as home prices rose at a slower pace. Average home-price growth in Brazil slowed to a 1 percent monthly pace in August from a high of 2.69 percent in April 2011, according to the Fipe Zap index.\nHomebuilders also declined in the first half of the year amid slowing growth in Brazil. Relatively low unemployment and rising incomes may help sustain the rally going forward, said Eduardo Silveira, an analyst at BES Securities. The unemployment rate fell to  5.8 percent in May from 6 percent the month before.\n\u201cMost companies went through a tough adjustment,\u201d SLW\u2019s Hood said. \u201cOnce economic growth picks up, they should be able to post better results.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Katerina Petroff in Sao Paulo at kpetroff@bloomberg.net ; Denyse Godoy in Sao Paulo at dgodoy2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jessica Brice at jbrice1@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:45:48", "post_time": "2012-09-18 16:41:15", "author": "Katerina Petroff , Denyse Godoy", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-18/gafisa-gains-75-as-builders-cash-crunch-ebbs-corporate-brazil.html", "title": "Gafisa Gains 70% as Builders\u2019 Cash Crunch Ebbs: Corporate Brazil", "post_date": "2012-09-18", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "2974d42f379fd077ded4923a3ca970364b9c0c65"}, {"content": "Brookfield Slumps to Lowest Since July 2009 as Profit Tumbles\nBy Katerina Petroff - 2012-05-14T13:55:20Z\nBrookfield Incorporacoes SA (BISA3) , Brazil \u2019s fourth-largest homebuilder by revenue, fell to the lowest level in almost three years as first-quarter profit fell 94 percent on higher building costs and contract cancellations.\nShares dropped 9.4 percent to 4.45 reais at 10:43 a.m. in Sao Paulo after touching 4.44 reais, the lowest intraday price since July 2009.

PT Astra International (ASII) , Indonesia\u2019s biggest car seller, reported a 17 percent advance while Arcelik AS (ARCLK) , Turkey\u2019s largest maker of washing machines, said profit rose 22 percent. Cia. Hering (HGTX3) , Brazil\u2019s second-largest apparel chain, and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. (Z) , India\u2019s biggest listed broadcaster, beat analysts\u2019 estimates.\nThe results signal interest-rate cuts in developing nations are spurring shoppers to buy non-essential items, which policy makers from Brazil to China are counting on to boost economic growth from the weakest pace since 2009, according to Prudential International Investments Advisers and GLG Partners. Profit gains are accelerating at emerging-market consumer companies even as growth for advanced-market peers slows.\n\u201cEarnings should be resilient\u201d for developing-nation consumer discretionary companies, Bart Turtelboom, the London- based co-head of emerging markets at GLG Partners, which oversees about $26 billion, said in e-mailed comments Aug. 14. \u201cValuations are at the lowest we have seen in a while, which makes the sector very attractive at current levels.\u201d\nRelative Valuations\nEmerging-market investors have their biggest overweight position in consumer discretionary companies , meaning they own more of the stocks than are represented in benchmark indexes, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of money managers who oversee about $277 billion this month.\nArcelik climbed 1.6 percent to a record in Istanbul trading today, while Hering slipped 0.2 percent at 12:12 p.m. in Sao Paulo . Astra dropped 0.7 percent and Zee Entertainment retreated 1 percent.\nThe MSCI index fell to 11.5 times profit on July 23, the lowest level since March 2009. The gauge\u2019s price-earnings ratio dropped to a record in June versus the MSCI Emerging Markets Consumer Staples Index, a measure of household-products makers, beverage companies and food producers such as Want Want China Holdings Ltd. (151) and BRF - Brasil Foods SA (BRFS3) , whose earnings are less tied to economic growth.\n\u2018Big Theme\u2019\nThe discretionary measure was valued at 12.8 times profits yesterday, a 19 percent discount to its five-year average. That compares with 17.8 times for the MSCI World Consumer Discretionary Index. (MXWO0CD) The developing-market gauge has rallied 8.2 percent during the past month, topping the 4.5 percent gain for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. (MXEF)\nThe discretionary index remains 4.7 percent below its level when emerging-market central banks, led by Brazil, began lowering interest rates in August 2011. The index surged 136 percent in 12 months after borrowing costs started falling four years ago.\nThe average policy rate in 15 developing nations tracked by Bloomberg has dropped by 44 basis points, or 0.44 percentage point, during the past year to 5.4 percent. That compares with benchmark borrowing costs near zero in the U.S. and 0.75 percent in the euro area.\nFood Inflation\n\u201cOne of our big themes is lower interest rates in the emerging markets in the second half of the year and that really points towards improving performance by consumer discretionary names,\u201d Geoffrey Dennis, a New York-based emerging-market equity strategist at Citigroup, said in an Aug. 8 interview with Bloomberg TV India.\nSlower economic growth may curb discretionary spending in emerging markets during the next 12 months, according to Arjuna Mahendran, the head of Asia investment strategy at HSBC Private Bank .\nChina\u2019s expansion has decelerated for six straight quarters, while retail sales slowed for five consecutive months through July amid a government crackdown on property speculation that reduced home prices.\nBrazil\u2019s gross domestic product expanded 0.75 percent in first quarter, the weakest pace since September 2009. The nation\u2019s consumer default rate hit a 30-month high of 7.9 percent in May, while consumer debt in Brazil increased 16 percent in the year through June to a record 546 billion reais ($270 billion), according to the central bank.\nProfit Growth\nBrazilian consumers are \u201cover-leveraged and under pressure,\u201d Michael Shaoul , the chairman of Marketfield Asset Management, said at the Bloomberg Brazil Economic Summit in Rio de Janeiro on Aug. 14. \u201cThe banking system is clearly trying to walk away from the consumer.\u201d\nHigher food prices may fuel inflation and reduce the scope for further interest-rate cuts, said Michael Ganske , the head of emerging-market research at Commerzbank AG in London.\nCorn rose to a record on Aug. 10 after droughts from the U.S. to Europe and Australia damaged crops. The S&P GSCI Agriculture Index has jumped 30 percent during the past two months as wheat and soybeans also surged. Food prices account for about 27 percent of consumer price indexes in emerging markets, compared with 16 percent in developed nations, according to Bank of America.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to justify discretionary really catching up in the short term,\u201d said Mahendran, who helps oversee about $500 billion from Singapore.\nAnalyst Upgrades\nWhile consumer purchases in emerging markets have slowed this year, they\u2019re still increasing at a faster rate than GDP. China\u2019s retail sales growth of 13.1 percent in July compares with a 7.6 percent gain in second-quarter GDP. Brazilian retail sales are climbing more than 10 times faster than the nation\u2019s economy, while Indonesian purchases are advancing twice as fast.\nThe 27 percent average profit gain for companies in the MSCI emerging discretionary index that reported second-quarter results so far compares with an 8.3 percent increase the previous quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings growth in the MSCI World discretionary gauge has slowed to 13 percent from 23 percent, the data show.\nAstra\u2019s second-quarter revenue advanced 32 percent, compared with an average gain of 11 percent for global peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At least four brokerages , including Sydney-based Macquarie Group Ltd., upgraded the stock this month after the results.\nBollywood\nThe Jakarta-based automotive retailer, which sells Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) cars and Honda Motor Co. (7267) motorcycles in Indonesia, is benefiting from record low benchmark interest rates and GDP growth that unexpectedly accelerated last quarter to 6.37 percent. The stock is valued at 16 times earnings, down from 18 times at the start of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nArcelik, which makes household appliances from vacuum cleaners to refrigerators, recorded the fastest profit growth since 2010 last quarter. The Istanbul-based company\u2019s revenue jumped 37 percent, triple the 12 percent average pace for global peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u201cThe demand for big-ticket items like cars and white goods is likely to pick up,\u201d John Praveen , the chief investment strategist at Prudential International Investments Advisers, a unit of Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential Financial Inc., which manages about $960 billion, wrote in an e-mailed response to questions. Praveen has an overweight position in emerging- market consumer discretionary shares.\nRate Cuts\nZee Entertainment, the Mumbai-based broadcaster of Bollywood movies and TV shows including \u201cDance India Dance,\u201d reported a 28 percent earnings gain, beating the average of analysts\u2019 estimates by 11 percent. The company, which gets revenue from subscriptions and advertising, will probably boost profit by 19 percent this year and next, according to 29 projections compiled by Bloomberg.\nHering, based in Blumenau, Brazil, is valued at 23 times profit, a 20 percent discount to its average during the past two years. The seller of Hering and PUC brand clothing posted a second-quarter earnings gain of 10 percent, and analysts predict annual growth will average more than 15 percent the next three years.\nThe percentage of delinquent consumer loans in Brazil fell in June for the first time in three months. Retail sales unexpectedly rose 1.5 percent from a month earlier, the most since January. The central bank cut interest rates eight times since last August.\n\u201cWe still like the consumption theme because of the rising income for most of the emerging markets,\u201d said Daphne Roth , who helps oversee about $200 billion as the Singapore-based head of Asian equity research at ABN Amro Private Banking. \u201cSome of the consumer discretionary stocks are still quite cheap.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Shikhar Balwani in Mumbai at sbalwani@bloomberg.net ; Gan Yen Kuan in Kuala Lumpur at ykgan@bloomberg.net ; Michael Patterson in London at mpatterson10@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Darren Boey at dboey@bloomberg.net\nAstra to Hering Earnings Growth Spurring Consumer Stock Rebound\nRachel Donnan/Bloomberg\nAstra\u2019s second-quarter revenue advanced 32 percent, compared with an average gain of 11 percent for global peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nAstra\u2019s second-quarter revenue advanced 32 percent, compared with an average gain of 11 percent for global peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Brazil\u2019s two-biggest utilities by market value , Cia. Energetica de Minas Gerais and CPFL Energia SA (CPFE3) , posted a 41 percent gain and a 2.4 percent drop, respectively.\nInvestors are betting that Sabesp will benefit from a tariff policy change being considered by regulators that may take effect as soon as November, said SLW Corretora analyst Erick Scott Hood and Omar Camargo Investimentos analyst Felipe Rocha. The company is also benefiting as slowing growth in Brazil, the world\u2019s second-largest developing economy, prompts investors to seek refuge in companies whose revenue is not as sensitive to swings in demand, Rocha said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a positive outlook for the tariff revision,\u201d said Vicente Koki, a utilities analyst at CGD Securities, who estimates a rate increase of about 8 percent in coming years. \u201cThe new tariff structure should bring better increases than in previous years.\u201d\nChanges to the model used to set tariffs by the Sao Paulo water and energy regulator, known as Arsesp , will make the rate changes more transparent and will reflect the pace of investments, Mario Azevedo de Arruda Sampaio, Sabesp\u2019s investor relations director, said by telephone.

The gauge climbed 1.5 percent last week after European Central Bank policy makers approved an unlimited bond-purchase program. The broader FTSE All-Share Index was also little changed, while Ireland\u2019s ISEQ Index fell 0.1 percent.\n\u201cA lot of those hopes for central-bank intervention are going to help sentiment, but I think there will be a lot of volatility near term,\u201d Yogi Dewan, chief executive officer at Hassium Asset Management LLP, said in a phone interview. \u201cWith so much uncertainty, we are really quite guarded. We would still sit on the sidelines.\u201d\nChina\u2019s imports unexpectedly declined, signaling more stimulus may be needed after the government last week said it approved road and subway projects across the country.\nChina\u2019s Imports\nInbound shipments to the world\u2019s second-largest economy slid 2.6 percent in August from a year earlier, while exports rose 2.7 percent, the customs bureau said in Beijing today. Industrial production increased 8.9 percent, the National Bureau of Statistics said yesterday.\n\u201cWe could be much closer to the tipping point for more policy action as the slowdown in the external sector -- if it were to persist -- may bring more pressure on employment,\u201d Morgan Stanley wrote in a report today.\nInvestors also await an announcement from the Federal Reserve on Sept. 13, following a two-day meeting of the U.S. central bank\u2019s policy-setting committee, for any evidence of new measures to stimulate the world\u2019s largest economy.\nKazakhmys gained 4.4 percent to 686.5 pence as copper climbed to its highest price in almost four months in London. Kazakhstan\u2019s biggest copper producer was upgraded to buy from sell at UBS AG today. Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , which mines for copper in Chile , rose 1.9 percent to 1,249 pence and Rio Tinto Group added 1.6 percent to 3,069 pence.\nBusiness Confidence\nIn the U.K., a report from BDO LLP showed that business confidence fell to a record low last month and a gauge of output indicated that the economy will remain weak.\nThe sentiment reading slipped to 89.1 from 93.1 in July, the accountancy company said in a report today. That was the lowest since the series began in 1992. The output measure dropped to 90.8 from 93.9, further below the 95 mark that points to positive growth one quarter ahead. BDO said the decline suggests growth \u201cis likely to remain elusive in the final quarter.\u201d\nXstrata gained 1.2 percent to 1,026.5 pence, extending its four-day advance to 12 percent. Glencore said today that Xstrata\u2019s Mick Davis will leave six months after a takeover of the Swiss mining company is completed under the sweetened and final terms of its $36 billion offer.\nDavis would run the combined group before handing over to Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg. That scraps an earlier plan for the Xstrata head to take the job. On Sept. 7, Glencore increased its offer to 3.05 shares for every one in the target, up from its February bid of 2.8 shares.\nMarks & Spencer\nMarks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS) added 2.7 percent to 371.1 pence, following a report that bankers have studied debt packages for a buyout of the U.K.\u2019s largest clothing retailer .\nSeveral private-equity firms have approached Marks & Spencer, Reuters reported on Sept. 7, without identifying the bankers. Bloomberg reported on Aug. 24 that CVC Capital Partners Ltd. has explored taking the retailer private, according to people close to the matter.\nABF (ABF) declined 2 percent to 1,280 pence, paring its rally this year to 16 percent. The retailer said second-half earnings will meet its forecast as sugar sales advance and growth accelerates at its Primark discount-clothing chain.\n\u201cWe do not expect changes to consensus estimates at this stage,\u201d JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts wrote in a report today after ABF\u2019s release. ABF \u201cshould deliver best-in-class earnings growth.\u201d\nSABMiller Slips\nSABMiller Plc (SAB) led a selloff in companies whose earnings are considered less tied to economic growth. The world\u2019s second- largest brewer lost 2.3 percent to 2,700 pence, Unilever, the world\u2019s second-biggest consumer-goods maker , dropped 1.3 percent to 2,245 pence and British American Tobacco Plc (BATS) slid 1.5 percent to 3,124.5 pence.\n\u201cBlue chip defensive stocks\u201d have been consistently weak in the past few days after the European Central Bank approved a plan to lower borrowing costs for euro-area governments, Investec\u2019s Martin Deboo wrote in an e-mail to Bloomberg.\nPunch Taverns Plc (PUB) plunged 9.9 percent to 6.3 pence as Citigroup Inc. lowered its recommendation for the U.K. pub operator to neutral from buy, citing a 20 percent year-to-date rally by pub and restaurant companies.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Alexis Xydias in London at axydias@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Andrew Rummer at arummer@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:46:50", "post_time": "2012-09-10 12:07:34", "author": "Alexis Xydias , Sarah Jones", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-10/u-k-stocks-are-little-changed-xstrata-climbs.html", "title": "U.K. Stocks Halt Two-Day Rally After Data; AB Foods Drops", "post_date": "2012-09-10", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "82ac17e6563d21d4ce9b9e82800dcb8e504bc6c3"}, {"stock_index": "IBOV"}, {"content": "European Stocks Post Largest Weekly Gain in Three Months\nBy Corinne Gretler - 2012-09-07T23:00:00Z\nEuropean stocks posted the largest weekly advance since June as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi outlined an unlimited bond-buying program to regain control of interest rates and stem the sovereign debt crisis.\nItalian banks led a gauge of European lenders to the best performance on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, with Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA and UniCredit SpA (UCG) rallying at least 16 percent. Ashtead Group Plc (AHT) , a U.K. construction-equipment rental company, rose to a record after saying full-year earnings will be higher than forecast. Rhoen-Klinikum AG (RHK) sank 23 percent.\nThe benchmark Stoxx 600 increased 2.3 percent to 272.30 this past week.

We have solved the liquidity side of the problem but if the economy continues to worsen, the discussion about solvency will rapidly come back. So it\u2019s very good news in the short-term, but still holds some risk for the medium-term.\u201d\nNational benchmark indexes increased in all of the 18 western European markets this week. The U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 rose 1.5 percent, France\u2019s CAC 40 added 3.1 percent and Germany\u2019s DAX Index climbed 3.5 percent. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rallied 6.7 percent, while Spain\u2019s IBEX 35 jumped 6.2 percent.\n\u2018Effective Backstop\u2019\nThe ECB will target government bonds with maturities of one to three years, including longer-dated debt that has a residual maturity of that length, Draghi said. Purchases will be fully sterilized, meaning that the overall impact on the money supply will be neutral, and the ECB will not have seniority, he said.\nThe program \u201cwill enable us to address severe distortions in government bond markets which originate from, in particular, unfounded fears on the part of investors of the reversibility of the euro,\u201d Draghi said at a press conference in Frankfurt on Sept. 6. \u201cUnder appropriate conditions, we will have a fully effective backstop to avoid destructive scenarios with potentially severe challenges for price stability.\u201d\nThe ECB left its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.75 percent this week, as predicted by 28 of 58 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The remainder had forecast a quarter-point cut. The Bank of England kept its rate at 0.5 percent and held its bond-purchase target at 375 billion pounds ($597 billion).\nManufacturing Contraction\nIn the euro-area, a report on Sept. 3 showed manufacturing contracted more than initially estimated in August, suggesting the economy may struggle to avoid a recession in the third quarter.\nA gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area based on a survey of purchasing managers was revised lower to 45.1 from the reading of 45.3 estimated earlier, London-based Markit Economics said. The index, which stood at 44 in July, has held for 13 months below 50, indicating contraction.\nA Labor Department report in Washington this week showed that payrolls rose less than projected in August and the unemployment rate declined as more Americans left the labor force , indicating the U.S. labor market is stagnating.\nThe economy added 96,000 workers last month following a revised 141,000 rise in July that was smaller than initially estimated, Labor Department figures showed in Washington. The median estimate of 92 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a gain of 130,000. Unemployment unexpectedly fell to 8.1 percent, and hourly earnings were unchanged.\nItalian Banks\nItalian banks led European lenders higher to post the best performance on the Stoxx 600 (SXXP) this week, with Monte Paschi (BMPS) and UniCredit rallying 18 percent and 16 percent, respectively. Unione di Banche Italiane SCPA (UBI) jumped 18 percent.\nCredit Agricole SA (ACA) climbed 15 percent, while Societe Generale SA (GLE) gained 16 percent.\nAshtead Group rose 17 percent after saying full-year earnings will be \u201cmaterially better\u201d than previously forecast.\n\u201cWe are past the worst and into a gentle recovery\u201d in the U.S., Chief Executive Officer Geoff Drabble said Sept. 4 in an interview. Ashtead is seeing a \u201csense of recovery\u201d in U.S. residential construction, though there is still concern about the government spending, Drabble said.

The Russian government plans to submit a law banning smoking in public places to Parliament by Nov. 1. The country has the second-largest tobacco market after China .

In March, the government imposed a tax on overseas borrowing to stifle capital inflows that are boosting the currency.\nThe shortage of credit dried up funds for replacing older sugar-cane stalks, which must be renewed every five years to maintain yields. At least eight of the nation\u2019s 420 processing mills are idle because of a lack of cane, threatening Brazil\u2019s lead over the U.S. as the biggest ethanol exporter. Brazil is the world\u2019s largest sugar producer.\nBrazil\u2019s growers \u201cneed to plant but simply don\u2019t have the financial resources,\u201d said Alexandre Grendene Bartelle, who is seeking to tap a credit line from BNDES to expand fields around two sugar-cane facilities he co-owns. \u201cMills are in financial troubles. They need this line of credit.\u201d\nReplanting Cane\nBrazilian growers replanted about 15 percent of their fields last year, less than the 17 percent annual replacement rate needed to maximize productivity, said Marcio Perin, an analyst at Informa Economics FNP, a consulting company in Sao Paulo. As much as 20 percent may be replanted this year.\nMills in the state were selling cane for 60.69 reais a metric ton at their gates in April, up 92 percent from an average of 31.55 reais in the 2008-2009 season.\nBNDES, formally named Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social, introduced its lending program in January, the first effort by President Dilma Rousseff to revitalize the cane crop.\nThe goal is 1 million hectares of new or replacement cane plantations. That would underpin supplies to hundreds of processors, led by Cosan SA Industria & Comercio, which along with Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) is the world\u2019s biggest operator.\nThe 72-month Prorenova loans are available through Dec. 31 and carry interest rates of about 9 percent -- a base rate of 7.8 percent plus a risk spread levied by the lender, said Alexandre Figliolino, regional director for Banco Itau BBA. That may be as much as 6 percentage points lower than similar loans from local commercial lenders, he said.\n\u2018Competitive\u2019 Rates\n\u201cThese rates are very competitive,\u201d Figliolino said in a telephone interview. \u201cEveryone\u2019s trying to access this credit.\u201d\nExcessive paperwork has prevented growers from completing their applications, which are submitted to commercial banks and then forwarded to BNDES once the file is complete.\nBNDES approved the first application yesterday, according to an e-mailed statement from the agency. It agreed to lend Maringa, Brazil-based sugar-cane processor Usina de Acucar Santa Terezinha Ltda. 226.2 million reais to develop 9,000 hectares of new fields and replant 58,000 hectares of old ones, according to the statement.\nOne daunting requirement for prospective borrowers is providing satellite imagery of mills\u2019 existing cane supplies as well as detailed maps of the plantations. That can be a challenge for small farmers with lands deep in Brazil\u2019s interior.\n\u2018Horrible\u2019\n\u201cBNDES operations are very bureaucratic and horrible,\u201d Paulo Roberto Luccas, commercial manager for the cane processor Tonon Bioenergia SA, said by phone.\nThe government also has made it more expensive to borrow abroad. Brazil imposed a 6 percent tax in March on loans and bonds issued abroad by local companies as part of an effort to weaken the real and make domestic goods more competitive overseas, said Arnaldo Correa, president of Sao Paulo-based Archer Consulting.\nKnown as the IOF tax, the duty on foreign borrowing was extended to loans and bonds with durations of as long as five years. Previously, it covered three-year deals.\nThe tax jeopardizes a widely used practice where cane companies sell their sugar before it\u2019s produced and use futures contracts as collateral for dollar-denominated loans that cover replanting costs, Correa said. As much as 60 percent of Brazil\u2019s cane producers finance crops this way, he said.\nOverseas Loans\nThose loans are often provided by lenders outside Brazil that are now subject to the IOF tax. Sugar producers prefer to borrow in dollars because they sell in the same currency.\nExtending the IOF tax \u201cis going to hurt our sugar- producing clients who have been accessing these three- to five- year credit lines ,\u201d Alastair Gourlay, a senior associate at the London-based international law firm Clifford Chance LLP, said in an e-mail.\nSugar-cane plants in Brazil are typically replaced every five years, and many are past their peak-production age, said Bartelle.\nSugar-cane stalks are cut near the base when harvested so they will regrow during the next season. The plants must eventually be replaced to maintain yield, at a cost of about 4,000 reais a hectare (2.5 acres), Jose Carlos Hausknecht, director of Sao Paulo-based agricultural consulting company MB Agro, said in a telephone interview.\nThe average age of Brazil\u2019s cane plants in 2011 was about 3 1/2 years, a year older than optimum, Hausknecht said.\nBNDES Plan\nBNDES is considering easing the requirements for the Prorenova program. The agency is scheduled to meet with commercial banks this month to discuss revising the application process, said Antonio de Padua Rodrigues, technical director for the sugar-cane trade group Unica.\n\u201cThe degree of success of the line depends on the changes it makes in May,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.\nReduced investments in crops mean \u201cthe U.S. could overtake Brazil this year\u201d as the world\u2019s biggest ethanol exporter, Hausknecht said.\nBrazil was usurped by the U.S. as the world\u2019s largest ethanol producer in 2006, and it almost ceded its place last year as the top exporter. The country exported 1.9 billion liters (500 million gallons) of ethanol in 2011 and imported 1.2 billion liters, mostly from the U.S., said Salim Morsy, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance\u2019s Sao Paulo office.\nThe country exported 5.1 billion liters in 2008 and imported about 500,000 liters, Morsy said. Maintaining that rate of production requires more flexible forms of finance for the industry, said Filho, the executive at Grupo Maubisa.\n\u201cThis credit is very much in demand,\u201d he said.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Stephan Nielsen in Sao Paulo at snielsen8@bloomberg.net ; Fabiola Moura in Sao Paulo at fdemoura@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Reed Landberg at landberg@bloomberg.net\nBrazil\u2019s $2 Billion Sugar-Cane Revival Plan Fails\nAdriano Machado/Bloomberg\nA worker cuts sugarcane in Goianesia, about 135 miles from Brasilia, Brazil.\nA worker cuts sugarcane in Goianesia, about 135 miles from Brasilia, Brazil.

"Agriculture Puts Surge After ETF Rises Most Since 2009: Options\nBy Cecile Vannucci, Jeff Kearns and Kaitlyn Kiernan - 2011-10-26T14:04:18Z\nOptions traders are snapping up protection against declines in agricultural stocks at the fastest rate in four years, locking in gains after a security that tracks the industry rallied the most since 2009.\nPuts to sell the Market Vectors Agribusiness exchange- traded fund outnumber calls 2.1-to-1, the widest gap in almost a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The ratio has jumped from 0.74 on Oct. 14 for the biggest increase since January 2008, the data show.\nThe fund tracking Monsanto Co. (MON) , Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, Deere & Co. (DE) and 43 other stocks rose 13 percent this month after falling 17 percent in September. Investors are adding to hedges before Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM) and 12 more companies representing 34 percent of the fund\u2019s total market value report quarterly results in the next week.\n\u201cDeere and the fertilizer companies are providing equipment to the global economy so if there\u2019s a slowdown in Europe and it affects Asia , there\u2019s going to be less demand for the products,\u201d Ann Miletti, who helps oversee about $209.1 billion as senior portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds, said in an interview yesterday at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. \u201cGlobal growth is the biggest question mark.\u201d\nPuts that pay should the ETF fall 22 percent from yesterday\u2019s close to $38 by May had the biggest gain in ownership over the past week, rising by 2,092 contracts to 12,634. The total is also the highest open interest among the fund\u2019s options, followed by puts priced at $40 and $42 in February, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nVolatility Decreasing\nImplied volatility, the key gauge of options prices, for the ETF\u2019s contracts expiring in 30 days plunged 38 percent from Oct. 4, when it reached the highest level since March 2009. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as the VIX, tumbled 21 percent during the period to 32.22 yesterday. The gauge\u2019s 21-year historical average is 20.50. It fell 3.7 percent to 31.03 at 10 a.m. New York time today.\nThe world economy will expand 4 percent in 2011 and 2012, the International Monetary Fund said on Sept. 20, reducing its forecast from June estimates of 4.3 percent and 4.5 percent. European stocks slid from an 11-week high yesterday after EU finance ministers canceled a meeting, fueled concern that the region\u2019s leaders may struggle to resolve the debt crisis.\n\u201cIf you remain pessimistic on a European solution, this is a good way to play it,\u201d said Andrew Wilkinson , chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York. \u201cThey\u2019re growth- sensitive stocks so if we\u2019re going to have a rerun to the downside then they would underperform.\u201d\nChina , Europe\nThe S&P GSCI Agriculture Index of commodities had its worst drop on record in September amid concern that China\u2019s economy is slowing and Europe can\u2019t contain its debt crisis. The gauge has gained 5.7 percent this month.\nTumbling commodities prices pushed down shares of agricultural companies, driving the price-earnings ratio on St. Louis-based Monsanto to 20.6 on Sept. 30, the lowest level in a year. Multiples fell to the cheapest since 2009 for Potash in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and Moline, Illinois-based Deere.\nU.S. consumers will pay 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent more for food this year than in 2010, up from a September forecast of 3 percent to 4 percent, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a monthly report. The world\u2019s population will probably climb above 7 billion at the end of this month, according to forecasts from the United Nations .\nEconomic Health\n\u201cThey really need what the U.S. and these agricultural companies can provide,\u201d David James , who helps oversee $2.5 billion as a senior vice president of James Investment Research Inc. in Alpha, Ohio , said in a phone interview yesterday. \u201cPeople have to be fed regardless of the state of their economy.\u201d\nThe United Nations World Food Price Index has fallen 5.3 percent from a record in February. In August, Orrville, Ohio- based J.M. Smucker Co. reduced what it charges for Folgers coffee, the top-selling U.S. brand, as arabica-bean futures dropped as much as 24 percent from a peak in May.\nInvestors poured $217 million into the agribusiness fund during the past month, the second-most among all U.S.-listed global equity ETFs, following the PowerShares QQQ Trust fund, according to data from XTF Inc., a New York-based research firm.\nThe cost of three-month puts on the agribusiness ETF cost 28 percent more than calls yesterday, down from a 40 percent premium on Aug. 30 that was the highest since December 2008.\n\u201cFor the last few years the agricultural sector was growing faster than the overall economy.\u201d Jake Dollarhide, who helps manage $65 million at Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma , said in a telephone interview yesterday.\n\u201cIt was pretty incredible growth, but unsustainable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole global economic situation can have nothing but a negative effect on demand for U.S. agricultural products.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Cecile Vannucci in Amsterdam at cvannucci1@bloomberg.net ; Jeff Kearns in New York at jkearns3@bloomberg.net ; Kaitlyn Kiernan in New York at kkiernan2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Baker at nbaker7@bloomberg.net ; Andrew Rummer at arummer@bloomberg.net\nAgriculture Puts Surge After ETF Rises Most Since 2009\nPaulo Fridman/Bloomberg\nMonsanto Co. soybean plants grow in a research field near Pirassununga, Brazil.

(AMRS) , a U.S. biotechnology company, formed a joint venture with ETH Bioenergia SA to process sugar cane into a raw material for fuel, its sixth such agreement in Brazil .\nThe venture will start producing farnesene, a chemical that can be transformed into fuel, in 2014, Emeryville, California- based Amyris said today in a statement. It will have access to an ETH Bioenergia mill that can process up to 2 million tons of cane annually for the venture.\nMore Brazilian sugar-cane mills have started selling energy to the national grid in recent years to reduce their dependence on the sugar and ethanol markets. Selling farnesene, Amyris\u2019s 15-carbon specialty chemical that can also be transformed into lubricants, would protect revenue further.\n\u201cWe\u2019re attractive to mills because we can help them diversify and expand the portfolio of products they offer,\u201d Joel Velasco, Amyris\u2019 senior vice president of external relations, said in a telephone interview today.\nETH Bioenergia, which is based in Sao Paulo and controlled by engineering and construction company Odebrecht SA, is focusing on ethanol production, he said. Prices for sugar have gained 133 percent to about 27 cents a pound during the past 36 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n15 Million Tons\nAmyris operates a small farnesene production plant in Sao Paulo state and is building facilities at mills owned by Sao Martinho SA (SMTO3) and Paraiso Bioenergia SA that will enable it to process up to 3 million tons of cane, he said.\nThe company has formed agreements with Cosan Ltd.

Unit Sues Idaho Wind Farm Developer for Payment\nBy Andrew Harris - 2012-08-27T21:25:52Z\nAn AES Corp. (AES) unit sued an Idaho wind-farm developer for allegedly failing to fully pay for 32 turbines and related equipment it agreed in May to buy for $34.6 million.\nExergy Development Group of Idaho LLC didn\u2019t fulfill the agreement after an initial delay resulted in a renegotiated payment schedule and a price increase of more than $3 million, according to a complaint filed at the U.S. court in Boise on Aug. 22.\nAES New Creek LLC is seeking an award of unspecified money damages including interest from Boise-based Exergy, according to the complaint. Exergy\u2019s chief executive officer said payment is forthcoming.\nIn a statement today, Exergy CEO James Carkulis attributed the slow payment to a case pending before the Idaho Public Utilities Commission which \u201chas made project financing reluctant to close on Idaho projects for several months.\u201d\n\u201cWe have put a substantial down payment on these turbines and we fully intend to complete our purchase and use them in other projects,\u201d Exergy\u2019s CEO said. \u201cWe have projects under development in 17 states, Argentina and Canada , over half of which shall be online by the end of 2013.\u201d\nExergy made a non-refundable payment of more than $1.7 million when the contract was signed on May 30, according to the AES complaint.\nAccording to its website , Arlington, Virginia-base AES Corp. is a 31-year-old developer and operator of traditional thermal power plants as well as solar- and wind-power generators with operations in 27 countries on five continents.\nAES rose 5 cents to $11.56 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.\nThe case is AES New Creek LLC v.

The rule had been put on hold by the court in December while it considered the regulation\u2019s legality.\nPeter Keisler, the former assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Justice Department in the Bush administration, argued the case before the appellate court. Working with him was Roger Martella, another partner from Sidley, who was the EPA\u2019s general counsel during the Bush administration . Sidley partners C. Frederick Beckner and Timothy Webster were on the team as well, representing Luminant, a unit of Energy Future Holdings Corp.\nAlso representing Luminant were Hunton & Williams LLP partner F. William Brownell and Balch & Bingham LLP partner P. Stephen Gidiere.\nLatham & Watkins LLP was also involved in the case, representing EME Homer City Generation LP, a unit of Edison International. (EIX) From Latham are partners Gregory Garre, Claudia O\u2019Brien and Lori Alvino McGill.\nFinally, partners Joshua Frank and William Bumpers of Baker Botts LLP represented Entergy Corp., Consolidated Edison Company of New York Inc., Northern States Power Co. - Minnesota , Southwestern Public Service Co. and Western Farmers Electric Cooperative.\nIn the 60-page opinion, Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote that \u201cour limited but important role is to independently ensure that the agency stays within the boundaries Congress has set. EPA did not do so here.\u201d\nThe court\u2019s decision, which sparked a rally in coal stocks, could leave the EPA with years of work to replace a regulation the agency said would have \u201cdramatic\u201d health benefits for 240 million people, Whitney Stanco, senior energy policy analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC, said.\nThe case is EME Homer City Generation LP v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 11-1302, U.S. Court of Appeals\nFor more on the decision, click here.\nDeals\nBracewell, Stinson, Debevoise on Kinder Morgan-Tallgrass Deal\nKinder Morgan Energy Partners LP (KMP) , the second-largest U.S. pipeline partnership, agreed to sell assets in the Rocky Mountains to private-equity backed Tallgrass Energy Partners LP for $1.8 billion in cash, a divestiture promised to antitrust regulators.\nKinder Morgan Energy will sell 7,200 miles (11,600 kilometers) of pipelines and two natural-gas processing facilities, the Houston-based company said Aug. 20 in a statement. The deal, which includes its Trailblazer Pipeline Co., Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission pipeline and a 50 percent interest in the Rockies Express pipeline, is valued at $3.3 billion including assumed debt, according to the statement.\nThe sale is the last requirement from Kinder Morgan Inc.\u2019s $22.8 billion takeover of El Paso Corp. in May. The Federal Trade Commission forced Kinder Morgan, which controls Kinder Morgan Energy, to sell some of its gas pipelines to reduce its dominance in the Rocky Mountain region.\nPartners W. Cleland Dade, Gregory M. Bopp, Heather L. Brown, Aaron P. Roffwarg, Jeffrey S. Whittle and Timothy A. Wilkins from Bracewell & Giuliani LLP represented Kinder Morgan.\nTallgrass, based in Overland Park , Kansas , is owned by its management as well as private-equity firm Kelso & Co. and a group of investors led by the Energy & Minerals Group.\nPartners Patrick Respeliers and Scot Hill from Stinson Morrison Hecker LLP in Kansas City , Missouri , represented Tallgrass.\nPartners Margaret Andrews Davenport, Paul D.

Carriers lost at least $1.7 billion in the first six days of the event, according to industry figures, with further disruption occurring just over a year later when the Grimsvotn caldera in Iceland blew.\nWhile the infra-red system EasyJet is testing dates from 1993 and airlines have long known that abrasive, silica-based material from volcanoes can clog engines and scar windshields, there was no interest from the industry until the 2010 eruption, according to the Norwegian Institute for Air Research .\nWhereas the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration imposes a 120 mile-buffer zone around areas of visible ash, Eurocontrol, which governs Europe \u2019s flight paths, based no-fly areas on models from the U.K. Met Office\u2019s Volcanic Ash Advisory Center that assess dust density according to weather forecasts .\nWhen Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull erupted, authorities ordered pilots to avoid all ash. The threshold was later changed so that they could fly through plumes where 0.002 grams of ash was present per cubic meter of air, and that limit was later doubled, subject to an airline getting approval from the engine maker.\nThe AVOID equipment was tested on a Flight Design CT light sport aircraft at altitudes of as much as 12,000 feet above Mount Etna and Stromboli in Italy at the end of last year. The system should eventually function between 5,000 and 50,000 feet.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Chris Jasper in London at cjasper@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Chad Thomas at cthomas16@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:48:13", "post_time": "2012-07-10 19:01:00", "author": "Chris Jasper", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-10/easyjet-tests-volcanic-dust-detector-using-saharan-sand-clouds.html", "title": "EasyJet Tests Volcanic-Dust Detector Using Saharan Sand Clouds", "post_date": "2012-07-10", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "884c7334cdbfee1da146f5e346c7c83a94e6475b"}, {"content": "Brazilian Stock Movers: BM&FBovespa, MMX, Rossi Residencial\nBy Zachary Tracer - 2012-03-28T20:58:11Z\nThe following companies had unusual price changes in Sao Paulo trading.

After fellow commissioners refused to follow her lead, she teared up as she worked on a statement accusing opponents of having their heads \u201cin the sand,\u201d two people involved in the process said.\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Schapiro\u2019s frustrations boiled over that August evening. She has told friends that the late nights and almost constant policy battles have left her exhausted and eager to depart after the November election.\nAdmirers and critics agree Schapiro rescued the agency from the threat of extinction when she was appointed by President Barack Obama four years ago. Still, she hasn\u2019t fulfilled her mission -- to overcome the SEC\u2019s image as a failed watchdog by punishing those who steered the financial system toward disaster and by proving regulators can head off future breakdowns.\n\u201cIt was harder than I thought it was going to be,\u201d Schapiro, 57, said during an interview in her office that looks out on the Capitol dome.\n\u201cYou have this nice little box of things you want to do all tied up with a bow, and you walk in the door and it\u2019s very hard to keep at least one eye on that agenda while you\u2019re dealing with the flash crashes and the new legislation and the whole range of things that happened,\u201d she said.\nNew \u2018Sheriff\u2019\nTaking over as the SEC was pilloried for letting bankers run amok and for missing frauds like Bernard Madoff \u2019s multi- billion-dollar Ponzi scheme, Schapiro won praise for tackling operational problems. Thrust into the limelight, she posed for the cover of Time magazine as a \u201csheriff of Wall Street \u201d and was ranked the world\u2019s 17th most-powerful woman by Forbes.\nShe soon found herself contending with issues ranging from stock-market technology going haywire to employees viewing pornography at work, while managing a raft of Wall Street probes and new rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nShe testified in Congress more than 40 times, advocating for the agency and admitting mistakes, including a $557 million, 10-year lease the SEC signed without competitive bids for about 900,000 square feet of office space, much of it unneeded.\nGoldman Settlement\nSchapiro rebuilt the enforcement unit with industry experts and more robust technology to root out wrongdoing related to the collapse of the housing bubble and rampant speculation in toxic debt instruments that froze credit and led to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the biggest in U.S. history.\nSEC lawyers forced Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to settle for $550 million and Angelo Mozilo, co-founder of lender Countrywide Financial Corp., to pay $67.5 million. The SEC also sued former heads of Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac , who are fighting claims they understated investments in subprime loans.\nStill, SEC lawyers didn\u2019t take action against anyone at Lehman or American International Group Inc. (AIG) , another firm at the epicenter of the credit crisis. The agency was attacked by lawmakers, judges and consumer groups for making few claims against individual Wall Street bankers.\nInvestor advocates who lauded Schapiro\u2019s appointment grew disappointed over time. They said she didn\u2019t have the fortitude to overcome splits inside the commission, lobbying and legal assaults by the financial industry and demands from a partisan Congress. That didn\u2019t play to her strengths as a conciliatory manager and career regulator.\n\u2018More Combative\u2019\n\u201cShe\u2019s been chairman at an extraordinarily difficult time,\u201d said Barbara Roper , director of investor protection for the Washington-based Consumer Federation of America. \u201cIt may be that the times called for someone either with a thicker hide or more combative nature.\u201d\nIn the view of some in the securities industry, Schapiro has been a balanced overseer. R. Cromwell Coulson, chief executive officer of New York-based OTC Markets Group Inc., said she did a good job dealing with events outside her control.\n\u201cShe had the three C\u2019s -- a crisis, Congress and the courts -- really boxing in her tenure,\u201d Coulson said.\nWith 4,500 employees in 11 outposts across the country, the SEC is an unwieldy behemoth. Its responsibility to police the markets includes such unrelated tasks as unearthing insider trades, examining disclosures about chemicals used in natural gas fracking and writing rules for trading technologies so new that experts can\u2019t agree how to define them. Even in smooth economic times, chairmen have struggled to tame the agency.\nCox\u2019s Party\nIn the 2008 crisis, Schapiro\u2019s predecessor, Christopher Cox , was sidelined as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson moved to rescue the financial system.\nCox, a former Republican congressman from California, was at a birthday party the night the government pushed the sale of Bear Stearns Cos. on JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) Later, when Paulson proposed a new regulatory blueprint that called for eliminating the SEC, Cox didn\u2019t express strong objections.\nCox was traveling and unavailable for comment, said a spokesman for law firm Bingham McCutchen LLP, where he works.\nSchapiro grew up in Babylon, New York, the daughter of a printer and a librarian. She graduated from Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, before earning a law degree from George Washington University. A political independent, she worked at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, was named an SEC commissioner by President Ronald Reagan in 1988 and returned to the CFTC as chairman under President Bill Clinton .\nCreating Finra\nIn 1996, Schapiro joined the National Association of Securities Dealers, a brokerage-industry oversight body, and about 10 years later led its merger with the New York Stock Exchange (NYX) \u2019s regulatory unit to form the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a Wall Street-funded overseer of more than 4,000 firms. Finra\u2019s board later issued a report criticizing the organization for missing signs of Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme as well as R. Allen Stanford\u2019s $7 billion fraud.\nFor a regulator, it was a lucrative job. Schapiro, who also served on the boards of Kraft Foods Inc. (KRFT) and Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) , received a payout of about $9 million as Finra\u2019s CEO when she left to head the SEC.\nSchapiro, the SEC\u2019s first female chairman, was installed as Obama administration officials floated a plan to strip down the regulator\u2019s responsibilities, or merge it into another agency.\n\u2018Incredibly Tense\u2019\n\u201cThe environment was just incredibly tense,\u201d Schapiro said in the interview. \u201cMadoff had just been arrested, the financial-crisis consequences were still unfolding, the market was plummeting and people were in fact talking about abolishing the agency.\u201d\nShe said her first job was \u201cto try to stem the tide of skepticism\u201d and then to focus on long-term needs. She removed hurdles for investigators and hired new senior staff. By the time Dodd-Frank was enacted a year and a half later, the SEC was handed wider jurisdiction and more funding.\n\u201cI give her enormous credit for -- virtually single- handedly -- preventing the commission\u2019s demise,\u201d former SEC chairman Harvey Pitt said, adding that her greatest contribution was \u201crestoring the agency\u2019s credibility and importance.\u201d\nSchapiro recruited Robert Khuzami , a former prosecutor then at Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , to head enforcement. He cut a layer of management, formed groups to focus on specialized areas of wrongdoing and created a system for handling tips about frauds. She tapped Carlo di Florio from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to revamp the inspections unit, which also had been faulted with missing the Madoff fraud.\nThe SEC says it has brought 115 cases related to the credit crisis, including 57 against senior managers. Yet big Wall Street CEOs and other executives haven\u2019t been among them.\n\u2018Unimpressive\u2019 Penalties\nIn March 2010, Lehman\u2019s court-appointed bankruptcy examiner publicly detailed the firm\u2019s questionable accounting methods, saying some top executives may have violated their duties to shareholders. While SEC investigators determined there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to bring a case, federal judges have allowed some shareholder lawsuits to proceed.\nLater that year, U.S. District Judge Ellen Huvelle scolded the SEC for extracting \u201cunimpressive\u201d penalties from two executives named in a $75 million settlement with Citigroup Inc. (C)\n\u201cWhen you bring this long complaint and make it sound like there have been all these misdeeds, who\u2019s responsible?\u201d the judge asked at a hearing in Washington. \u201cThese things don\u2019t happen without individuals.\u201d\nSEC \u2018Misconceptions\u2019\nKhuzami said in a December speech that critics are fueled by \u201cmisconceptions\u201d about the SEC\u2019s powers. He has said that bad business decisions aren\u2019t necessarily fraudulent and that if there is a fraud, regulators need hard evidence that top executives knew about it before they can file a case. He also has defended the practice of allowing firms to settle without admitting wrongdoing, saying it resolves actions that otherwise could drag for years through the courts.\nCriticism of the record, though, resonates even inside the SEC. Commissioner Luis Aguilar , a Democrat, said in a Washington speech yesterday that public concern about the lack of financial-crisis cases against executives was understandable.\n\u201cThe investing public has a right to expect that government regulators will continue to hold accountable those individuals responsible for misconduct -- and that includes those culpable at the top, not just the flunkies below,\u201d Aguilar said.\nLynn Turner , a former SEC chief accountant, said that the agency\u2019s actual enforcement record signals to Wall Street that the tough talk is just rhetoric.\nBehind Schedule\nSchapiro \u201chas created a culture where it is better to ask for forgiveness than beg for permission,\u201d Turner said. \u201cAnd the trouble is, she always forgives them.\u201d\nAside from legal action against Wall Street, the most visible part of the SEC\u2019s work under Schapiro involves Dodd- Frank, the biggest rewrite of finance regulation since the Great Depression. Two years after Congress handed the SEC the challenge of crafting almost 100 rules, the agency is behind schedule on about half of them, according to a tally by Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP.\nDaniel Gallagher, a Republican commissioner, said rules haven\u2019t been taken up in the order of their importance. In a Sept. 24 speech, he called Schapiro\u2019s agenda a \u201cscattershot menu of short-term and reactive priorities.\u201d\nGallagher questioned, for example, why Schapiro devoted time to regulations related to where firms get their minerals and how they account for natural-resource extraction. Instead, he said, the SEC should have focused on fixes that could prevent another crisis, such as the Dodd-Frank mandate that the agency remove references to credit-rating companies from its rule book.\n\u2018Bold Action\u2019\nThe companies had been lambasted for giving top ratings to securities that turned out to be toxic, helping to fuel the crisis. Excluding them would protect investors \u201cmore than any other action the commission has taken since Congress took bold action to give the SEC formal oversight of credit-rating agencies,\u201d Gallagher said.\nJeff Connaughton, who was chief of staff to Ted Kaufman, then a Democratic senator from Delaware, said Schapiro\u2019s equanimity has kept the agency from solving tough policy problems such as how to cope with changes in the structure of the markets.\nConnaughton, author of \u201cThe Payoff: Why Wall Street Always Wins,\u201d said he pressed Schapiro to harden rules for high- frequency trading before and after the so-called flash crash --a May 6, 2010, market drop that temporarily erased $862 billion from stock values.\nPragmatic Manager\n\u201cShe is a regulator by consensus,\u201d Connaughton said. \u201cI could tell from the first time I met her that there was not a whiff of boldness about her.\u201d\nSchapiro said she\u2019s a pragmatist who believes that building a consensus is the way to navigate among strongly opposing views and \u201cactually accomplish things.\u201d\nShe disagreed with Gallagher\u2019s assessment, saying that although the agency isn\u2019t finished it has already removed references to credit-rating firms from 18 rules, in some cases before Dodd-Frank was even passed. She said she has balanced deadlines set by lawmakers with the need to respond to real-time challenges.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had one of the busiest rule-making periods in the entire history of the agency,\u201d Schapiro said.\n\u201cDoes everybody have individual things they\u2019d love to see at the top of the queue? Without a doubt. Myself included,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have to follow a script that Congress laid out for us.\u201d\nWhistleblower System\nSchapiro said she\u2019s confident her agenda has produced significant progress. She cited the money she poured into new technology for managing cases and handling tips, a program to pay whistleblowers and a tripling of the staff-training budget. She hired industry experts and created a division to sniff out market risks and perform economic analysis for rules.\nUnder her supervision, she said, the enforcement unit filed \u201cmore complex and consequential\u201d cases and returned a record $3.6 billion to investors from penalties in fiscal years 2010 and 2011.\nSchapiro also restructured the unit that reviews company disclosures to focus on large financial institutions and to probe for gaps in filings by firms selling shares to the public for the first time. That was the unit that pressed both Groupon Inc. (GRPN) and Facebook Inc. (FB) to provide investors with more details before their initial public offerings.\nStartup Act\nOn another issue related to IPOs, Schapiro drew criticism from consumer groups and investor advocates.\nIn April, Obama signed the bipartisan Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, which aims to spur investment in new firms. Among other things, it allows closely held companies to sell shares over the Internet via \u201ccrowdfunding\u201d and lets hedge funds advertise for investors. After the House passed its version and the Senate was about to take it up, Schapiro wrote a March 12 letter to lawmakers asking that the bill be \u201cmodified to improve investor protections.\u201d\nArthur Levitt , a former SEC chairman who said he applauds Schapiro for pulling the agency back from the brink in 2009, was disappointed by her response to the bill. He said the agency\u2019s failure to aggressively oppose the JOBS Act \u201cwas the lowest point\u201d of her tenure.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that Mary wrote a letter, but it was far less firepower than was required to fight legislation more harmful to investor interests than any in my memory,\u201d said Levitt, who is a board member of Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News .\n\u2018They\u2019re Done\u2019\nRoper, of the consumer federation, said it was the responsibility of Schapiro and the rest of the SEC\u2019s leadership to make sure the bill didn\u2019t unravel protections against fraud and abuse that had been in place for decades.\n\u201cIt says they don\u2019t feel the same responsibility to measure harm to investors as much as they have to measure the cost to businesses,\u201d said Roper. \u201cIf that holds out, then they\u2019re done as an investor-protection agency, and that will be her lasting legacy.\u201d\nFor Schapiro, her legacy was meant to include money-market funds. While her proposal collapsed in the face of industry opposition and her inability to persuade her fellow commissioners, she said she still considers the process \u201ca big success\u201d because it raised public awareness that is helping to revive the push for new rules.\nRegulators see what happened in 2008 as a warning that money funds could precipitate another crisis. The $62.5 billion Reserve Primary Fund \u201cbroke the buck\u201d -- its share price fell below $1 -- because it held $785 million in Lehman debt when the broker went bankrupt. Reserve Fund clients rushed to redeem their shares, and the panic spread.\nExtra Capital\nThe issue is \u201cthe big one,\u201d Schapiro said in the interview. \u201cI would say money funds is the most important for us to tackle.\u201d\nHer plan, developed in conjunction with the Treasury and the Fed, called for funds either to hold extra capital to prepare for stress or get rid of their stable $1 share price, which lulls investors to think they can\u2019t lose money. While many investors treat the funds as though they were savings accounts , they aren\u2019t protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\nSchapiro gave speeches, testified in Congress and oversaw the drafting of a 300-page proposal. Mutual-fund companies, saying the changes would destroy rather than save the product, enlisted the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in a lobbying campaign. They blanketed the Washington subway station next to the agency\u2019s headquarters with ads attacking the plan.\nTelegraphing Doubts\nBy the end of last year, Schapiro knew that at best she had a 3-2 majority -- her own vote and those of the two Democratic commissioners, Aguilar and Elisse Walter. Gallagher and the other Republican member, Troy Paredes, had already indicated they thought changes weren\u2019t necessary.\nIn the following months, fund companies and their supporters met with commissioners, including 11 times with Aguilar, SEC disclosures show. He began to telegraph his doubts, saying more study might be needed.\nWhen her plan was ready, Schapiro set an Aug. 29 vote. About a week before the meeting, Aguilar told Schapiro he\u2019d decided not to support it.\nSchapiro and her aides huddled in her office. They considered going ahead with the vote anyway, on the theory the session might publicly shame Aguilar and the two Republicans blocking the changes, according to the two people with knowledge of the Aug. 22 meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\u2018Too Important\u2019\nInstead, Schapiro decided to cancel the vote and issue her statement . \u201cThe issue is too important to investors, to our economy and to taxpayers to put our head in the sand and wish it away,\u201d she wrote.\nSome dissenting commissioners took her comments personally, further straining relations. Gallagher, for instance, read the statement in a news story while taking a train home. He called Schapiro from his mobile phone, blasting her for not warning him, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talk was private.\nIn the interview, Schapiro said she wasn\u2019t trying to take shots at her colleagues.

It suggests the law should be changed to give the central bank\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority the power to approve bank mergers and acquisitions when it takes over responsibilities from the FSA next year.\n\u201cIt is crucial that the PRA takes on board an important lesson from this report -- there is no substitute for the exercise of judgment,\u201d Andrew Tyrie , chairman of the cross- party Treasury Committee, said in a statement in London today.\nLawmakers in the U.K. are having a greater say in the way banks are run and policed than at any time in recent decades. They used today\u2019s report to demand they are consulted on sanctions against directors of banks and on the PRA\u2019s role. Tyrie also chairs a separate panel that is looking at standards in banking and whether plans to erect firewalls around banks\u2019 retail operations are being watered down.\nToday\u2019s report said the FSA showed poor judgment and should have intervened in the 72 billion-euro ($94 billion) purchase of Amsterdam-based ABN Amro with Banco Santander SA (SAN) of Spain and Belgium\u2019s Fortis, a deal that brought RBS to the brink of collapse.\nFSA Resistance\nLawmakers also criticized the Bank of England and the Treasury for their role and attacked Adair Turner , the FSA\u2019s chairman and a front-runner to succeed Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England, for initially resisting a postmortem of the affair.\nAfter acquiring ABN Amro, RBS reported a 24.1 billion-pound ($39 billion) loss for 2008, the largest in U.K. corporate history, and required a 45.5 billion-pound rescue by taxpayers - - the world\u2019s biggest bank bailout. The FSA came under pressure from lawmakers to publish the probe into RBS after the agency cleared bank executives, including former Chief Executive Officer Fred Goodwin , of wrongdoing.\nEven after global money markets froze in 2007, Goodwin pushed through the ABN Amro deal, the world\u2019s biggest bank takeover. The acquisition saddled RBS with bad debt and depleted its cash reserves.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Gonzalo Vina in London at gvina@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Hertling at jhertling@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:49:19", "post_time": "2012-10-18 19:01:00", "author": "Gonzalo Vina", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-18/lawmakers-say-boe-should-get-powers-to-veto-bank-mergers.html", "title": "Lawmakers Say BOE Should Get Powers to Veto Bank Mergers", "post_date": "2012-10-18", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "80bcb95fd33b8125ecac0c9f7338f752395db665"}, {"content": "Brazilian Stock Movers: Aliansce, BM&FBovespa, Cemig, Vanguarda\nBy Alexander Cuadros - 2011-10-25T20:28:58Z\nThe following companies had unusual price changes in Sao Paulo trading.

Nine companies had outstanding exchange filings to hold IPOs in Latin America \u2019s second-biggest economy, Javier Artigas, head of strategic planning at the exchange, told reporters on Jan. 10.\nAlfa, which plans on keeping a controlling stake in Alpek, will price the shares between 27.50 and 31.50 pesos, according to prospectus filed with the local exchange.\nBanregio has surged 16 percent since its IPO, while OHL has retreated 22 percent.\nMicrofinance business Credito Real SA and bus company Grupo Senda Autotransporte SA are among companies that have said they\u2019re considering listing shares in Mexico.\nBrazil\u2019s first initial public offering since July, Sao Paulo-based car-rental company Cia. de Locacao das Americas, priced shares 36 percent below the upper end of its target. Unicasa Industria de Moveis SA, a furniture maker in Brazil, will announce the results of its IPO tonight. Colombian construction company Construcciones El Condor (ELCONDOR) raised 162.6 billion pesos ($91 million) in an initial sale this month.\nSlim\u2019s Frisco\nThe Alpek sale -- known as a carve out because Alfa will keep control -- would resemble an offering carried out in January 2011 by billionaire Carlos Slim \u2019s holding company, Grupo Carso SAB. After that deal, Slim\u2019s mining unit, Minera Frisco SAB, soared 26 percent in its first day of trading. It\u2019s up 93 percent since the IPO, beating the 0.4 percent gain in the IPC.\n\u201cAlfa is seeking to maximize shareholder value ,\u201d said Ramon Leal, Alfa\u2019s chief financial officer, in an April 11 telephone interview from London . The public offer gives Alpek \u201cthe opportunity to have more independence to pursue the projects that have been presenting themselves.\u201d\nEnrique Flores Rodriguez, head of Alfa\u2019s corporate communication, declined to comment further.\nCarve outs can help pull in new buyers because investors sometimes shy away from hard-to-value conglomerates, according to Josef Schuster, founder of Chicago-based Ipox Schuster LLC, which has about $2 billion tied to indexes that track IPOs.\nPolyester Sales\nAlpek, based in San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico , has 20 plants in three countries and had sales of $7.3 billion last year, about half of Alfa\u2019s $14.7 billion total. First-quarter revenue rose 13 percent to $1.1 billion amid higher polyester sales in North America , the company said in a filing with the Mexican stock exchange.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a stable old company, and from a diversification perspective it makes good sense,\u201d said Schuster, who said he\u2019s considering participating in the sale. Carve-outs in other markets \u201chave been very successful.\u201d\nAlfa fell 0.9 percent to 187.74 pesos in Mexico City trading yesterday. It\u2019s up 24 percent this year, compared with a 4.8 percent advance for the benchmark gauge, which rose April 2 to a record high 39,963.64. The benchmark needs to climb another 2.9 percent to surpass its historic high.\nCitigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG and Morgan Stanley are managing the Alpek share sale.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jonathan J.

While it only has 20 percent of the Mexican wireless market after a decade of operations, compared with 71 percent for Slim\u2019s America Movil (AMXL) SAB, Telefonica considers the country a key market, Abellan said.\n\u201cWe know this path is the right one,\u201d he said. \u201cOur commitment is to Mexico, without question.\u201d\nLast year, Mexico\u2019s government cut by more than half the fees that wireless carriers get to connect calls to their users, crimping Telefonica\u2019s profit. The carrier\u2019s operating profit margin in the country, leaving out depreciation and amortization, fell to 23.9 percent in the first half of 2012 from 26.8 percent a year earlier.\nVenturing Outside\nTelefonica is adding employees in Mexican cities with populations of about 1 million, venturing outside the nation\u2019s three largest metropolitan areas, Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey. In many of the smaller cities, only 50 percent to 60 percent of people have mobile-phone subscriptions, Abellan said.\nSmall companies, including sole proprietorships and businesses with five to 250 employees, have a similar lack of services in Mexico compared with multinational corporations, presenting an opportunity for Telefonica, he said.\nAmerica Movil \u2019s press office didn\u2019t immediately respond to phone and e-mail requests for comment.\nTelefonica has 7 billion pesos ($544 million) budgeted for Mexican investments this year, while America Movil, which has wireless and land-line networks in the country, said in March it would spend 32.5 billion pesos on network improvements.\n\u2018Market Dominance\u2019\n\u201cEven if this move could bring some growth for Telefonica in Mexico, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to see any meaningful impact on the parent company in the short term,\u201d said Pedro Oliveira , an analyst at Banco BPI in Porto, Portugal . \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see that happening, without some regulatory changes in order to reduce America Movil market dominance.\u201d\nWhile Telefonica hasn\u2019t completed its full budget for 2013, it will spend a total of 3.12 billion pesos this year and next to build speedier networks, Abellan said. A network using long- term evolution technology, or LTE, is already available in parts of Mexico\u2019s three biggest cities, he said.\nTelefonica also announced a wireless plan yesterday that gives users unlimited access to social networks such as Facebook Inc. (FB) and Twitter Inc. when they pay at least 200 pesos a month for voice calls.\nTelefonica shares gained 0.1 percent to 10.72 euros in Madrid today. The stock has dropped 19.9 percent this year, which compares with the 8.5 percent decline by the benchmark IBEX 35 Index.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Crayton Harrison in Mexico City at tharrison5@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:36:06", "post_time": "2012-09-27 11:59:04", "author": "Crayton Harrison", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-26/telefonica-sees-mexican-sales-growth-in-markets-where-slim-isn-t.html", "title": "Telefonica Sees Mexican Growth in Markets Where Slim Isn\u2019t", "post_date": "2012-09-27", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "MEXBOL", "embers_id": "183d05766a7b1f340449b6ee9caaaf7a661fde2e"}, {"content": "NII Bets $3 Billion on Turnaround Starting in Slim\u2019s Turf\nBy Crayton Harrison - 2012-09-25T20:15:13Z\nNII Holdings Inc. (NIHD) , the Latin American mobile-phone carrier whose shares have declined 64 percent this year, is anchoring its turnaround on a $3 billion plan to compete better against the world\u2019s richest person on his home turf.\nNII is set to announce today that it will begin service tomorrow on its 3G, or third-generation, mobile-phone network in Mexico , giving smartphone users a new option in a market where Carlos Slim \u2019s America Movil (AMXL) SAB dominates. NII, which is based in Reston, Virginia , and operates under the Nextel brand, will initially offer 3G plans in 34 cities, said Gustavo Cantu, vice president of the company\u2019s Mexican unit.\nWith the new network, NII can offer more advanced phones and services such as faster video downloads to encourage subscribers to spend more and keep them from switching to its bigger rival . NII, which carved out a niche in Latin America by offering a walkie-talkie service to business clients, is seeking to persuade investors it can reverse declines in Mexican customer spending and loyalty.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re able to participate in the data market, they should be able to grow revenue,\u201d said Kevin Smithen, an analyst at Macquarie Securities USA Inc. in New York . \u201cExpectations are low on this name, so that\u2019s a really important thing.\u201d\nNII, a former unit of Nextel Communications Inc. (S) , won a government auction of mobile-phone airwaves in 2010 to get the capacity for the network, bidding $14.2 million. The company will pay 18.3 billion pesos ($1.42 billion) over 20 years for government licensing fees and has pledged to invest about $1.5 billion in the network over five years.\nFaster Speeds\nThe new service will use a technology called HSPA+ that can offer download speeds of as much as 21 megabits a second, Cantu said yesterday in a phone interview. The network\u2019s first phase includes the largest metropolitan areas in the country, such as Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla and Cancun.\nThe company will sell 3G phones and laptop cards. The handsets will include those for the walkie-talkie service, known as push-to-talk, with the ability to communicate with devices using NII\u2019s old network and its new one, Cantu said.\n\u201cThere are a lot of users that we haven\u2019t been able to offer high-speed data to in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had the technology and the range of services and devices that we have now.\u201d\nSmallest Carrier\nNII is the smallest of Mexico\u2019s four mobile-phone carriers, with about 4 percent of wireless subscribers. America Movil , based in Mexico City, has 71 percent. Madrid-based Telefonica SA (TEF) , which has operated in Mexico for a decade, has 20 percent of users. Grupo Iusacell SA, controlled by billionaire Ricardo Salinas and broadcaster Grupo Televisa SAB (TV) , has 5 percent.\nSince NII hasn\u2019t been able to offer a full range of wireless services before, Mexico\u2019s phone regulators consider the company a new entrant in the market, which allowed it to get its 3G airwaves at a lower price than competitors in the 2010 auction. That doesn\u2019t mean it represents a significant competitive threat to America Movil, since its push-to-talk service tends to attract a small segment of business users who can afford higher prices, Smithen said.\nAn America Movil official, who asked not to be named under company policy, declined to comment.\nMexico is NII\u2019s second-biggest market behind Brazil , with 3.8 million subscribers at the end of June. Mexican sales dropped 7.8 percent in the first half of this year to $1.07 billion, while operating profit shrank 43 percent to $137 million as the company cut prices to hold on to users. The average Mexican customer\u2019s bill shrank 19 percent from a year earlier to $39 a month in the three months ended June.\nLower Forecasts\nNII cut its 2012 profit and sales forecasts in August after missing analysts\u2019 expectations for net income for the seventh straight quarter. The company, which also operates in Argentina, Peru and Chile , has struggled with higher customer turnover as users defect to competitors offering faster download speeds and more popular handsets. Churn, a measure of turnover, rose to 2.3 percent last quarter from 1.71 percent a year earlier.\nAfter hitting a nine-year low of $5.93 on Aug. 29, the shares have rebounded, climbing 28 percent. The shares fell 3.2 percent to $7.61 at the close in New York. Chief Executive Officer Steve Dussek buoyed investor optimism in the company\u2019s turnaround last week by boosting his stake by 12 percent to almost 400,000 shares, including unvested, restricted stock.\nSmooth Start\nA smooth start to NII\u2019s Mexican service would help reassure investors after previous 3G network debuts in Peru and Chile were plagued by outages and a lack of handset supply, said Christopher King , an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore. Shareholders will view the Mexico network\u2019s performance as an indicator of how NII will fare when it starts offering 3G service in Brazil later this year, he said.\n\u201cThe fact that this is coming on schedule, with the timing they laid out since the beginning of the year, is positive,\u201d King, who advises buying the shares, said yesterday in a phone interview. \u201cIt should give people confidence from a technology standpoint that they\u2019re on the right path.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Crayton Harrison in Mexico City at tharrison5@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:36:09", "post_time": "2012-09-25 16:15:13", "author": "Crayton Harrison", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-25/nii-bets-3-billion-on-turnaround-starting-in-slim-s-turf.html", "title": "NII Bets $3 Billion on Turnaround Starting in Slim\u2019s Turf", "post_date": "2012-09-25", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "MEXBOL", "embers_id": "e899c6c3b6e8f35fcd67ff6fe949b139aa90c8a4"}, {"content": "World\u2019s 40 Richest Gain $29 Billion as Global Stocks Rise\nBy David de Jong - 2012-09-14T23:18:13Z\nThe 40 richest people on Earth added a combined $29.5 billion to their collective net worth this week as global stocks soared.\nThe biggest gainer was Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The Microsoft co-founder gained $1.2 billion after reports that the company may announce a 15 percent increase to its quarterly dividend later this month. Gates is worth $65.1 billion.\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) chairman Warren Buffett has a net worth of $47.5 billion. The 82-year-old said yesterday that he completed his last prostate-cancer radiation treatment. Buffett ranks fourth in the world.

That\u2019s up from 30 percent last year and 10 percent in 2010.\nWatch Live: CDP's Global Climate Change Forum at 9 a.m. New York time on Sept. 12\n\u201cThere\u2019s an attention to extreme weather events which are in many cases disrupting businesses\u2019 operations and supply chains,\u201d Carbon Disclosure Project Executive Chairman Paul Dickinson said yesterday in a phone interview. \u201cLegislative action and extreme weather events are coming together to provide a tipping point for companies to pay attention to emissions.\u201d\nThe number of companies incorporating climate change into business plans rose 10 percentage points this year, and those that monitor their emissions have proved a better investment than those that don\u2019t, according to the report. Even so, the pace of emissions cuts is nowhere near what\u2019s needed, said co- author PwC.\nGerman drugmaker Bayer and Swiss foodmaker Nestle topped the CDP\u2019s list of companies disclosing and cutting carbon, followed by Spanish utility Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS) , German automaker Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and chemical company BASF SE (BAS) , also from Germany.\nTaxing Carbon\nEmissions targets show companies plan to trim CO2 by 1 percent a year, a quarter of the rate that global consultant PwC says is needed to meet the United Nations goal of constraining global warming since the 18th century to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\u201cWhat\u2019s needed is government action -- taxation and regulation of greenhouse gases,\u201d said Dickinson. \u201cCO2 is a valueless pollutant, so it\u2019s not really possible to address without government action.\u201d\nRelated: Why Is the U.S. Backward, and Other Climate Questions\nGreenhouse pollutants are already traded in the European Union, where corporate emissions are capped, with systems in operation or being set up in countries and regions including Australia, New Zealand , South Korea, China, California and nine states in the northeast U.S.\n\u201cIt is vital that we internalize the costs of future environmental damage into today\u2019s decisions by putting an effective price on carbon,\u201d Carbon Disclosure Project Chief Executive Officer Paul Simpson said in the report\u2019s forward.\nBiggest Companies\nThe CDP requested data from the so-called Global 500 companies, the biggest by market capitalization in the FTSE Global Equity Index Series. A total of 405 businesses supplied the information, though today\u2019s report is based only on the 379 that replied by July 31.\nThe 379 respondents reported emissions totaling 3.6 billion metric tons. That\u2019s a decline of more than half a billion metric tons, equivalent to pollution from 138 million cars, from 2009, when 409 replies were processed.\nRelated: Politicians Who Deny Climate Change Can't Be Pro-Business\nAbout 82 percent of companies said they have set themselves emissions targets, though only 20 percent had goals to 2020 and beyond. Seventy-eight percent said they integrate climate change into their strategy, and 96 percent said they have a board member or senior executive with oversight of climate change.\nThe top 10 was rounded out by U.K. drinks-maker Diageo Plc (DGE) , Finnish mobile phone maker Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , German insurer Allianz SE (ALV) , Swiss bank UBS AG (UBSN) and Japanese electronics maker Panasonic Corp. (6752)\nTop 10\nA total of 51 of the companies surveyed were included in the project\u2019s Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index for 2012 after meeting requirements for transparency of emissions reporting and performance in reducing greenhouse gases over the past year. Nineteen are American, seven are German and four are Swiss.\nA separate report on the members of the S&P 500 Index (SPX) of U.S. stocks showed that 52 percent said they were attempting to cut their emissions, up from 35 percent last year. The proportion of companies seeking outside verification of their emissions data almost doubled to 42 percent.\nThe reports were carried out by CDP on behalf of 655 institutional investors with $78 trillion in assets.\nRelated: Top 1,000 Companies Wield the Power of Nations\nAn investment in a basket of stocks based on the Global 500 disclosure leadership index, and rebalanced each year to reflect the new index members would have generated total returns of 67 percent, compared with the 31 percent return from an investment in all the Global 500 members, according to the study.\nResilient Future\n\u201cCompanies that work to decouple greenhouse gas emissions from financial returns have the potential for both short and long-term cost savings, sustainable revenue generation and a more resilient future,\u201d Simpson said.\nMore than four-fifths of companies said climate change posed an immediate or future physical risk to their operations, up from 71 percent last year.\n\u201cRecent extreme weather and natural events have tested companies\u2019 business resilience and increased their level of understanding of the timeframes of the physical risks they associate with climate change,\u201d the study said. \u201cPhysical risks are viewed as tangible and present, impacting companies\u2019 operations, supply chains and business planning.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Alex Morales in London at amorales2@bloomberg.net .\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Reed Landberg at landberg@bloomberg.net .\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:36:14", "post_time": "2012-09-12 08:57:10", "author": "Alex Morales", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-11/bayer-nestle-lead-carbon-cutting-effort-as-climate-risk-grows.html", "title": "Bayer, Nestle Lead Carbon-Cutting Effort as Climate Risk Grows", "post_date": "2012-09-12", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "MEXBOL", "embers_id": "42b099442832604a288febe33cdee414aab62cf9"}, {"content": "World\u2019s Richest Gain $25 Billion as Zong Now Top in China\nBy Max Raskin - 2012-09-07T21:33:10Z\nThe 40 richest people on the planet added $25.3 billion to their collective net worth this week as global equities soared.\nOne of the biggest gainers was Amancio Ortega , who gained $1.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

They also have other advantages including services and total space, despite the fact that it might not be in perfect condition,\u201d he said.\nRomero, whose family paid 2.2 million pesos ($168,000) for a 3-bedroom, 200-square meter (2,152-square foot) house in Satelite, a middle-class neighborhood in the northern metro area, said that if they had bought a new home, they would have had to settle for an apartment in a more remote suburb.\n\u201cI have shopping centers and schools nearby,\u201d Romero said. The existing home \u201cgave us room to be able to put enough money into the home so that it ended up exactly the way we wanted it.\u201d\nAt Romero\u2019s home, a terrace overlooks her garden and the main bedroom is equipped with a private bathroom and dressing area.\nUrban Growth\nMexican towns are pouring into one another, with the Mexico City metropolitan area expanding in area by 3.6 times between 1980 and 2010, according to a 2011 report from the Social Development Ministry. In the same period, the population increased just 1.4 times to 20.1 million people. The central Mexican cities of Queretaro and Toluca multiplied in area by 16 times and 26 times, respectively, in the past 30 years, according to the government.\nThe housing boom of the 2000s spawned three initial public offerings by builders in 2003 and 2004 and a subsequent industrywide rally that ended in 2007\u2019s collapse. The Habita (HABITA) index of six Mexican homebuilders has dropped 80 percent in the five years through yesterday. The gauge rose 0.5 percent at 8:42 a.m. in Mexico City trading.\nDemand Decline\nThe increasing availability of previously-owned home options is supporting consumers even as builders struggle from a decline in demand, said Ariel Cano, head of Mexico\u2019s National Housing Commission.\n\u201cThe need for a home doesn\u2019t exclusively imply the need for a new property,\u201d Cano said in a July 31 phone interview from Mexico City. \u201cFor developers, that might imply an adjustment of their growth expectations. That\u2019s the main micro problem for these companies.\u201d\nAll three of Mexico\u2019s biggest homebuilders posted negative free cash flow to equity in the first half of the year, a sign that the businesses are spending money faster than they\u2019re taking it in, said Banorte\u2019s Hermosillo. Free cash flow to equity measures cash left for equity holders after costs, investments and debt payments.\nGerardo Copca, an analyst with research company Metanalisis SA, said it\u2019s unlikely existing home sales will continue taking market share from the new market because of the shortage of housing.\nHousing Shortage\nMexico\u2019s government estimates a housing deficit of nine million families without a home or living in substandard conditions.\nThe increase in existing home sales is \u201ctemporary,\u201d Copca said by phone from Mexico City. \u201cThe housing deficit in Mexico is still high, even if there\u2019s more offer today.\u201d\nMexican mortgage lending climbed 6.3 percent in the first half of 2012 to 287,000 credits, according to data compiled by the local unit of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA. (BBVA) Creditors provided 114.8 billion pesos ($8.75 billion) in mortgages in the period, according to BBVA Bancomer, as the Mexico City-based unit is known.\nThe Mexican economy will grow 3.8 percent in 2012, almost double the 2.2 percent pace for the U.S., according to the median forecasts in separate Bloomberg surveys. The nation\u2019s central bank has held the key rate a record low 4.5 percent since 2009.\nDeveloper Urbi\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Selene Avalos said the company is considering ways to turn the growing used housing market into an \u201copportunity,\u201d including by helping resell abandoned homes in its communities.\n\u2018Community Problem\u2019\nThose homes \u201cshould be put back on the market,\u201d Avalos said in an interview yesterday at Bloomberg\u2019s Mexico City office. \u201cAn unoccupied home is a problem for the community.\u201d\nBenchmark dollar borrowing costs for Homex, Corp. Geo and Urbi have jumped an average of 127 basis points, or 1.27 percentage point, in the past two months. Yields on Urbi\u2019s dollar bonds due in 2020 soared 217 basis points in the period, the most of the three.\nHomebuyers in Mexico will keep shifting preference to existing properties until the country increases the availability of services outside its cities, Alfredo Viegas, a managing director for emerging markets at Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG) , said by phone from Greenwich, Connecticut .\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here is just simply the fact of buyer revolt against moving that far away from their places of employment,\u201d Viegas said. \u201cYou probably need a more significant upgrade in the infrastructure to allow the suburbs and exurbs to flourish, because the infrastructure\u2019s not exactly up to par.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jonathan J.

The San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico-based carrier, which is also weighing a share sale, must repay $825 million of debt by 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe company needs cash after cutting prices to defend its market share against billionaire Carlos Slim \u2019s America Movil (AMXL) SAB. Axtel has 1.04 million phone lines in Mexico, lagging behind the 14.6 million of America Movil\u2019s Telmex unit.\n\u201cThey have to do something,\u201d said Manuel Jimenez, an analyst at Banorte Ixe Casa de Bolsa in Mexico City. \u201cThey\u2019re very squeezed in terms of cash and they\u2019re very leveraged.\u201d\nSelling the towers would be preferable because they\u2019re not essential assets to run the business, Jimenez, who advises selling Axtel shares, said in a phone interview today. A sale of parts of the fiber network would be less optimal, he said.\nStandard & Poor\u2019s downgraded Axtel\u2019s debt one level today to CCC+, or seven levels below investment grade, citing weakening earnings due to competition.\nDebt Due\nAxtel has a $60 million syndicated loan due in 2015, $275 million in bonds due in 2017 and $490 million in bonds due in 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While it also has access to a revolving credit line of $40 million, it expects to be able to draw down $20 million of that credit over the next 18 months because of its current liquidity situation and terms negotiated with lenders.\nYields on Axtel\u2019s bonds due in 2017 have surged 598 basis points, or 5.98 percentage point, to 26.01 percent in the past month, the steepest selloff in Mexico , according to data on the Bloomberg. The shares rose 1.7 percent to 2.44 pesos at the close in Mexico City, paring their drop this year to 45 percent.\nThe assets for sale would allow a buyer to lease capacity to Axtel and its rivals. Many of Axtel\u2019s 1,000 wireless towers have space for a second or third phone company to install equipment, de los Santos said.\nWiMax Service\nAxtel offers a wireless Internet service , WiMax, to residential and business users. Some of its towers also have equipment for various other wireless technologies used by business customers for internal communications. The towers could be used for several services, including mobile-phone networks, de los Santos said.\nThe company isn\u2019t considering selling its government licenses to use wireless airwaves for WiMax and other technologies, de los Santos said. Those assets wouldn\u2019t be as attractive to a buyer because they wouldn\u2019t have enough capacity to lease to multiple phone companies, he said.\nAxtel, which drew the syndicated loan from five banks, is seeking advice from some of them, de los Santos said. The banks are Citigroup Inc. (C) \u2019s Mexican unit Banamex, Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB, Credit Suisse Group AG, ING Groep NV and Standard Bank Plc, he said, without identifying the advising banks.\nThe company, which paid a record $78 million in interest in the year ended June 30, still has about $66 million of interest payments due in the next eight months. The amount exceeds its cash reserves of about $64 million.\nAxtel is also considering a plan to induct a partner into its information-technology services unit. An outside investor would provide the funds to pursue growth in that business, Chief Financial Officer Felipe Canales said last month on a conference call.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Crayton Harrison in Mexico City at tharrison5@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:37:32", "post_time": "2012-08-10 17:31:57", "author": "Crayton Harrison", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-10/axtel-seeks-300-million-in-phone-asset-sales-to-avoid-default.html", "title": "Axtel Seeks $300 Million in Asset Sales to Avoid Default", "post_date": "2012-08-10", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "MEXBOL", "embers_id": "25d9cd1fc5c785e076fe44ae6bab89d244022a84"}, {"content": "Mexico Equity Movers: Soriana, Geo, Axtel, Penoles\nBy Patricia Laya - 2012-07-27T20:55:44Z\nIPC rose 1.2% to 41,476.48 at the close of trading, with 26 stocks rising and eight falling.\nADVANCERS: *Corp.

Loosening their grip would give Mexican consumers more choices and more money to spend. It would also spur economic development and invigorate political and economic institutions, thereby helping society combat the effects of the drug war violence that has led to more than 47,000 deaths over the past six years.\nIn a campaign focused more on personalities than policies, the three leading candidates -- Enrique Pena Nieto of the Institutional Revolutionary Party , Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of the Democratic Revolution Party and Josefina Vazquez Mota of the incumbent National Action Party -- didn\u2019t necessarily dwell on this concentration in the Mexican economy. Yet two telling examples in energy and telecommunications spell out its negative consequences for ordinary Mexicans and why the next president needs to undertake a wide-ranging reform. For different reasons, both are also of symbolic importance.\nNo cow is more sacred than Petroleos Mexicanos , or Pemex, the state-owned oil company created in 1938 by the expropriation of foreign companies. Partly as a result of a ban on foreign investment in the oil sector -- a prohibition that Mexico shares with Iran and North Korea -- Pemex\u2019s output has been declining for almost a decade, and it has lagged in finding and exploiting new reserves. Electricity production (which relies heavily on oil) is also controlled by a state monopoly notorious for its high prices (nearly twice as high as in the U.S.) and poor service. This year, the World Bank and International Finance Corp. ranked Mexico 142 out of 183 countries in the ease of getting electricity.\nLike Pemex, Carlos Slim , the world\u2019s richest man, may be a source of pride for some Mexicans. But they probably feel less warm toward his company, America Movil SAB, which controls 80 percent and 70 percent, respectively, of the landline and mobile telephone markets. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, high prices and poor service in telecommunications cost Mexico about $25 billion a year from 2005 to 2009, equivalent to 2 percent of gross domestic product. (Slim\u2019s company disagrees with that assessment .) Mexico also ranks near the bottom of OECD countries in market penetration for fixed, mobile and broadband service, and investment per capita is lower than in any other OECD country.\nTelevision is effectively a duopoly between Grupo Televisa SAB, which controls 70 percent of the free-to-air TV and about half of the cable and satellite pay-TV market, and TV Azteca SAB. (AZTECACP) Mexico\u2019s Federal Competition Commission estimates that more competition in pay TV could reduce prices and grow the size of the market by more than a third.\nThe list of outsized companies cited for squelching competition goes on, including Cemex SAB, the largest cement maker in the Americas, and Grupo Bimbo SAB, the world\u2019s largest bread maker. According to Eduardo Perez Motta, the head of the competition commission, poor Mexicans (who made up 51 percent of the population in 2010) pay as much as 40 percent more for basic goods and services because of monopolistic practices.\nTheir hopes for deliverance would now seem to rest with the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, the party once dubbed \u201cthe perfect dictatorship\u201d by Nobel Prize-winner Mario Vargas Llosa for its seven-decade rule. If polls are correct, Pena Nieto is poised to carry the PRI back into the presidential residence at Los Pinos after a 12-year absence.\nWe hope that Pena Nieto will live up to his lofty but vague calls for reform, beginning with his plan to amend the constitution to allow private investment in the oil industry. Much will depend on whether his coalition can build the absolute majority in Congress needed to effect that change. The new governing party would need to hope for a constructive attitude from the incumbent National Action Party , which saw the PRI stymie many of its efforts at reform. As the party that first nationalized the oil industry, the PRI has the \u201cNixon-went-to- China\u201d credibility to bring along the nation on this momentous change.\nOn our list of other steps that Pena Nieto could take to spur competition would be dropping his reluctance to lift the 49 percent foreign-ownership cap on fixed telephone lines. Beyond his proposal for dedicated antitrust courts, we hope that he will pursue other judicial reforms to even the playing field between deep-pocketed companies and still-relatively weak regulatory agencies. While Mexicans are neuralgic about foreign economic interventions, the U.S. and the European Union can help by expanding professional exchanges and consultations with Mexico\u2019s competition commission.\nDeeper challenges abound, such as increasing Mexico\u2019s tax base, bringing more workers into the formal economy and taking on the powerful teachers\u2019 union that has retarded the country\u2019s educational progress. Political reforms over the past two decades, some set in motion by the PRI, have reduced the likelihood of its reversion to a \u201cperfect dictatorship.\u201d Now, by injecting more competition into the Mexican economy -- and restoring faith in government by more vigorously taking on the \u201cother\u201d cartels -- the PRI can help ensure that the country\u2019s future is brighter than the party\u2019s past.\nRead more opinion online from Bloomberg View .

Tensions have intensified between the companies and Slim\u2019s America Movil SAB (AMXL) because the broadcasters are pushing into the mobile-phone market, Slim\u2019s main source of revenue. Last week, Mexico\u2019s antitrust agency said Televisa and Azteca should offer spots to rivals at the average price that other advertisers pay, as a condition for them to form a wireless-industry partnership.\nSlim, 72, has relied on newspapers, online advertising and cable-TV networks to advertise his wireless service, Internet plans and retail stores. His move away from over-the-air TV came as the broadcasters encroached on the telecommunications industry he dominates.\n\u201cWe have been able to manage our marketing strategy very well,\u201d Carlos Slim Domit, the son of the billionaire and the co-chairman of America Movil, said in an interview yesterday. \u201cYou can have a very strong strategy using new media and using alternate media to get your products\u2019 image to the customer.\u201d\nSlim\u2019s Portion\nAt the time he pulled his TV ads, Slim represented about 1.5 percent of Televisa\u2019s sales and 3 percent of Azteca\u2019s. When asked if the antitrust settlement would cause Slim\u2019s companies to reconsider their strategy for advertising purchases, Slim Domit, 45, deferred to the broadcasters.\n\u201cThey are the ones that put us out, so the question is more for them,\u201d he said in Los Cabos, Mexico , where he was attending the G-20 business summit.\nDan McCosh, a spokesman for TV Azteca, declined to comment. Televisa didn\u2019t have an immediate comment.\nThe two broadcasters control almost all of the over-the-air TV audience in a country where only about 40 percent of households have cable or satellite subscriptions.\nTelevisa controls three cable-TV units that are offering Internet and phone service, taking market share away from Slim. The Mexico City-based broadcaster agreed this week to conditions set by the antitrust agency, allowing the company to take a 50 percent stake in mobile-phone carrier Grupo Iusacell SA to compete even more closely with America Movil.\nThe other half of Iusacell is owned by Ricardo Salinas , the billionaire who controls TV Azteca.\nMovil Share\nEven without TV advertising , America Movil has held about 70 percent of Mexico\u2019s wireless market consistently over the past 18 months. Iusacell has increased its share to 6 percent from less than 5 percent, trailing Telefonica SA (TEF) \u2019s 20 percent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the result of all the work our marketing areas have done, doing a lot of research, a lot of focused advertising,\u201d Slim Domit said. \u201cIt\u2019s been consistently successful for us.\u201d\nAmerica Movil has pleaded with the government for a license to offer TV service over its home-phone lines to compete with Televisa\u2019s cable units. The government says America Movil still must satisfy requirements for the way its network connects to competitors, a claim America Movil disputes.\nMexican phone regulators approved a framework agreement, developed with carriers including America Movil, earlier this month that could settle much of the dispute with the government, Alejandro Gallostra, an analyst with Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, said in a June 14 research note. He said he expects America Movil to get a TV license in the next 12 months.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t got any news changing the decision, but we will see,\u201d Slim Domit said. \u201cWe believe we have accomplished all the requirements.\u201d\nAmerica Movil gained 1.8 percent to 17.46 pesos at the close in Mexico City. Televisa slid 1.2 percent to 54.85 pesos, and Azteca rose 1.9 percent to 8.46 pesos.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Crayton Harrison in Mexico City at tharrison5@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net\n17:32\nJune 19 (Bloomberg) -- Carlos Slim Domit, the eldest son of the world\u2019s richest person and chairman of the billionaire\u2019s holding company Grupo Carso SAB, talks about his family's business strategy.

Alwaleed\u2019s fortune has increased 18.2 percent, or $3.2 billion, this year, as shares of his Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM) , a diversified investment group that is planning to build the world\u2019s tallest tower, rose 36 percent. The 57-year-old ranks 24th on the index with a net worth of $20.5 billion.\n\u201cThere is no secret to success,\u201d Alwaleed said in an e- mail sent from Saudi Arabia. \u201cIt is based on a sound investment strategy, commitment and long-term vision.\u201d\nThe Bloomberg Billionaires Index takes measure of the world\u2019s wealthiest people based on market and economic changes and Bloomberg News reporting. Each net worth figure is updated every business day at 5:30 p.m. in New York . The valuations are listed in U.S. dollars.\nThe expanded list was published with the release of new billionaires profile pages in the Bloomberg Professional service. The profiles feature a transparent analysis of how each billionaire\u2019s fortune was calculated.\nAlwaleed\u2019s fortune makes him richer than Google Inc. co- founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Page ranks in 29th place with $18.9 billion, while Brin ranks 32nd on the list compiled by Bloomberg News. He is worth $18.7 billion.\nBuffett, Zuckerberg\nThe combined wealth of the index is $1.1 trillion. The 40 billionaires have gained a combined $88.2 billion since the beginning of the year.\nMexican telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim , 72, remains the richest person in the world, with a fortune of $68.8 billion, down $572.3 million for the day. Second is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates , 56, with $62.7 billion, followed by Warren Buffett, who\u2019s worth $44.6 billion.\nBuffett, 81, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , said in an April 17 letter to investors that he has been diagnosed with stage 1 prostate cancer that is \u201cnot remotely life threatening.\u201d\nMark Zuckerberg , the 27-year-old founder of Facebook Inc. (FB) , the world\u2019s largest social-networking company, is 25th on the ranking. Based on a roughly $100 billion valuation the Menlo Park, California-based company was trading at in the private market when it ceased trading April 3, Zuckerberg may be worth $20.5 billion, or about 25 percent less than previous estimates, once Facebook holds its initial public offering.\nTax Obligations\nThe reason: Facebook will issue more than 500 million shares of its Class B stock at the offering, diluting Zuckerberg\u2019s ownership to 21 percent after he exercises 120 million options and sells about 42 million shares to cover the tax bill associated with the gain from those options.\nLee Shau Kee, who has said he would swap 99 percent of his wealth for 30 years of time, ranks 26th in the world and second in Hong Kong with a net worth of $19.8 billion. Lee, 84, has gained $2.6 billion this year after shares of Henderson Land Development Co., the developer he founded, rose 17 percent.\nCheng Yu Tung, the third-richest person in Hong Kong, has a net worth of $18.8 billion.

His net worth is down 6.2 percent so far this year.\nIndia, Australia\nLakshmi Mittal, the India-born chairman of ArcelorMittal (MT) , the world\u2019s biggest steelmaker, is in 28th place with $19 billion. In addition to his 41 percent stake in ArcelorMittal, the 61-year-old London resident owns hundreds of millions of dollars in U.K. real estate.\nGina Rinehart, the Australian mining heiress, is worth $18.7 billion, putting her in 31st place on the index. Rinehart, 58, the daughter of the man who discovered the mines that made Australia the world\u2019s biggest iron ore exporter, owns perpetual royalty rights to some of Rio Tinto Ltd. (RIO) \u2019s Hamersley mines in addition to other iron-ore and thermal coal deposits throughout the country.\nThree of her four children have taken legal action in an effort to remove her as guardian of the family trust. Last month, she lost a bid to keep details of the family litigation private. Newly released documents indicate her four children may have a stake worth as much as $4.7 billion in the trust.\nLi Ka-shing , 83, ranks as the richest person in Asia with a net worth of $23.9 billion.\nUsmanov Tops Akhmetov\nUkrainian tycoon Rinat Akhmetov , 45, ranks 36th. His $18 billion fortune is derived from closely held metallurgy, mining and energy holdings owned through System Capital Management JSC. In government auctions held between November 2011 and March 2012, Akhmetov\u2019s DTEK Holdings Ltd. acquired control of significant Ukrainian state coal and energy assets at prices that helped push up his net worth up by more than $3.5 billion since the auctions began.\nAlisher Usmanov, the 58-year-old Muscovite who controls the Metalloinvest metals and mining company and Digital Sky Technologies, became Russia\u2019s richest person after lucrative technology investments in Facebook, Groupon and Zynga pushed his fortune to $19 billion, up $1.6 billion this year.\nGennady Timchenko, who controls a portfolio of international energy and oil trading assets, the largest of which is a 45 percent stake in Gunvor Group Ltd., is worth an estimated $12.1 billion.

Putin also was chairman of a judo club Timchenko co-founded.\nChocolate Empire\nMichele Ferrero, who owns the closely held Ferrero SpA chocolate empire, is Italy\u2019s richest citizen with $21.9 billion. Since 1949, he has been the family leader of the global chocolate and confectionery company that makes Nutella, Tic Tac and Ferrero Rocher.\nAlberto Bailleres, the second-richest man in Mexico behind Slim, is worth $18.5 billion. His net worth has soared $1.3 billion this year. While his most-valuable asset, Industrias Penoles SAB, Mexico\u2019s largest silver producer and a miner of gold, has only gained 1 percent in 2012, Bailleres, 80, has benefited from a strengthening currency. The Mexican peso is the best performer among major currencies this year, up 5.7 percent against the dollar.\nIris Fontbona, the matriarch of Chile\u2019s richest family, ranks 34th. Fontbona, her three children and two heirs from the late Andronico Luksic\u2019s previous marriage, control a combined fortune of $18.4 billion. The family owns copper producer Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) and, through holding company Quinenco SA (QUINENC) , interests in banking, beer and shipping.\n40th Place\nJorge Paulo Lemann is the second-richest man in Brazil with a net worth of $15.9 billion. He ranks last on the ranking.\nThe 72-year-old tripled his latest investment after he and his partners at 3G Capital Inc. sold a 29 percent stake in Burger King Holdings Inc. this month for $1.4 billion, valuing the fast-food chain at $4.8 billion. As part of their 2010 leveraged buyout, 3G put up $1.5 billion in equity and loaded at least $2.5 billion of debt onto the company\u2019s balance sheet.\nCarl Icahn didn\u2019t make the cut. The activist investor, 76, has a net worth of $15.6 billion based mostly on his stakes in Icahn Holdings, a hedge fund he closed to outside investors in 2011, and publicly traded Icahn Enterprises LP. (IEP)\nIcahn last week sued Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AMLN) , in which he is the third-largest shareholder, demanding records related to a $3.5 billion takeover offer by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. as he seeks to start a proxy fight against Amylin\u2019s board.\nRicardo Salinas , 56, also fell short. His stake in Grupo Elektra SA plunged 25 percent in the past week, leaving him with a net worth of $15.8 billion. The retail and banking conglomerate posted its biggest two-day drop since at least 1994 as new Mexican stock-exchange rules threaten to cut the company\u2019s weight in the benchmark index. Salinas\u2019s stake in the company has dropped $4.4 billion since April 11.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Alexander Cuadros in Sao Paulo at acuadros@bloomberg.net ; Devon Pendleton in New York at dpendleton@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew G.

Azcarraga\u2019s company also is willing to offer concessions to the nation\u2019s antitrust agency to win approval for its planned entry in the mobile-phone market, he said.\nMexico loses 2.2 percent of its gross domestic product annually from high mobile-phone prices and low Internet use, Azcarraga said, citing a study by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. Slim has tried to block competition in telecommunications and has used legal tactics to delay regulators, Azcarraga said, without providing examples.\n\u201c Mexico is changing for the better. Televisa is too,\u201d Azcarraga said. \u201cSo should someone with the vision, the talent and the clout of Carlos Slim.\u201d\nArturo Elias , Slim\u2019s spokesman, didn\u2019t immediately return phone and e-mail messages seeking comment.\nSlim\u2019s mobile-phone company, America Movil SAB (AMXL) , has sought legal orders of constitutional protection against decisions on tariffs and interconnection rules by the nation\u2019s phone regulator. Telefonica SA (TEF) and Grupo Iusacell SA (CEL*) have used similar tactics.\nMexico\u2019s antitrust agency voted in January to block Televisa\u2019s $1.6 billion plan to take a 50 percent stake in Iusacell, the third-largest mobile-phone carrier in Mexico, after America Movil and Madrid-based Telefonica.\nBroadcasting Alliance\nThe agency rejected the deal in part because it would have created an alliance between Televisa and Ricardo Salinas , who controls Iusacell and TV Azteca SAB, Televisa\u2019s biggest broadcasting rival. Such a partnership might encourage the broadcasters to work together in the TV business, in which they already attract almost all over-the-air viewers, the agency concluded.\nTelevisa is willing to create \u201cfirewalls\u201d to address the agency\u2019s concern, Azcarraga said.\nAlso in January, Mexico\u2019s Federal Telecommunications Commission decided against taking a vote on whether to go forward with plans to grant new broadcast television licenses.\n\u201cWhile we may have seemed against this in the past, Televisa does not oppose the creation of a third, fourth or even fifth nationwide broadcast TV network,\u201d Azcarraga said. \u201cIf and when the Communications Commission announces the terms of an auction for additional television frequencies, we will not legally challenge it -- so long as the rules create a level playing field for competition.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Crayton Harrison in Mexico City at tharrison5@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Ville Heiskanen at vheiskanen@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:37:57", "post_time": "2012-03-23 00:01:00", "author": "Crayton Harrison", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-23/televisa-s-azcarraga-urges-slim-to-compete-welcomes-tv-networks.html", "title": "Televisa\u2019s Azcarraga Urges Slim to Compete, Welcomes TV Networks", "post_date": "2012-03-23", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "MEXBOL", "embers_id": "e88f5ada64d9a5dbd2cdeb2ba04e8dabca48683c"}, {"content": "Mexico Stocks: Urbi, Corp.

Dreibus - 2012-08-30T19:43:16Z\nKansas farmers are preparing to plant winter wheat into the driest soil since 1991 as three seasons of drought causes Dust Bowl conditions in the biggest growing state and global reserves fall to a four-year low.\nAbout 97 percent of fields in the state had too little moisture as of Aug. 19, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Kansas is having its hottest year ever, leaving all 105 counties as federal disaster areas. The worst U.S. drought since 1956 spread to wheat-growing Great Plains states after damaging corn and soybean yields in the Midwest and driving prices for both crops to a record.\nThe International Grains Council cut its stockpile forecast for the third time in as many months Aug. 23, and the United Nations said in July that grain prices drove the biggest monthly gain in food costs since 2009. Wheat reached a four-year high in July, boosting costs for Panera Bread Co. and Grupo Bimbo (BIMBOA) SAB, and may jump another 8.5 percent to $9.80 a bushel in three months as droughts limit output from the U.S., Russia and Ukraine, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n\u201cWe just have no subsoil moisture at all,\u201d said David LeRoy, a 56-year-old who farms 3,000 acres about 10 miles west of Great Bend, Kansas, and plans to start sowing winter wheat next month for harvesting in June. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to have a wet winter to raise any wheat at all. When you have a small amount of rain, like we have, nothing wants to grow.\u201d\nCrop Rallies\nFutures surged 38 percent this year to $9.03 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, second only to the 46 percent advance in soybeans. Both overtook a 25 percent gain in corn among the 24 commodities tracked by the Standard & Poor\u2019s GSCI Spot Index, which rose 3.4 percent. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities added 7.1 percent, and Treasuries returned 2.1 percent, a Bank of America Corp. Index shows.\nThe lack of any significant rain in Kansas through July resulted in the driest three months for the state since at least 1890, according to the Western Regional Climate Center. Temperatures from January through July averaged 59.4 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius), a record for the period, said Mary Knapp, the state climatologist in Manhattan , Kansas.\nGlobal wheat stockpiles will drop 10 percent before next year\u2019s harvest to 177.2 million metric tons, the lowest since 2009, the USDA said Aug. 10. Russia \u2019s harvest may fall 24 percent, Kazakhstan \u2019s is seen tumbling 52 percent, Ukraine may reap 32 percent less, and Australian output is forecast to drop 12 percent, the USDA said. The last time supplies were that tight, Russia imposed export restrictions that lasted 10 months.\nDisaster Areas\nAbout 70 percent of the U.S. harvest comes from winter wheat planted in September and October. The rest is spring wheat sown in June. The outlook dimmed after fields dried up from Ohio to Texas to Montana and the government declared half of all counties disaster areas. The USDA, after predicting record corn harvests in June, said this month that output will plunge 13 percent this year after kernels withered.\n\u201cThe really extreme drought has shifted westward,\u201d said Dan Manternach, a wheat economist at Doane Advisory Services in St. Louis . \u201cThey\u2019re doing some field work, but some have stopped field preparations because it\u2019s too dry. That\u2019s unusual because usually if it\u2019s this dry, they say: \u2018Let\u2019s at least make a cloud of dust\u2019.\u201d\nU.S. farmers may still plant winter wheat because most will be guaranteed $8.60 to $8.80 a bushel from insurance policies even if the crop fails, said Doug Etheridge, a senior vice president in futures and options at RBC Wealth Management in Charlotte , North Carolina . Before the drought sparked a rally, futures averaged about $7.16 this year through mid-June.\nExport Sales\nSurging prices may curb demand for U.S. grain and boost sales from Canada , the fourth-largest exporter, where production is rising for a second consecutive year. U.S. shipments overseas reached 5.69 million tons from June 1 to Aug. 16, 13 percent less than a year earlier, USDA data show. The government\u2019s official forecast is for a 14 percent increase in sales in the year that began June 1.\nWorld wheat supplies are \u201csufficient\u201d to meet global demand even if Russia decides to limit exports, and prices may decline by the end of the year, Capital Economics Ltd. said in a report yesterday. In the year ended May 31, the top exporters were the U.S., Australia , Russia and Canada, USDA data show.\nU.S. farmers may be depending on an emerging El Nino weather pattern to bring more water in the next several months. That may boost rainfall in parts of Texas, the second-largest winter-wheat grower, state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon wrote in a report on Aug. 21. Winter wheat is planted from September through November, goes dormant when temperatures drop and resumes growing in April or May.\nDust Bowl\nPlants may not survive that long without more rain, especially in Kansas. The southwest corner of the state has had three consecutive years of drought, leaving an increased risk of a return to the devastation of the Dust Bowl era in the late 1930s, according to Jim Shroyer, an agronomist at Kansas State University in Manhattan. Lack of crop production in the region means fewer plants and roots to keep the dirt in place.\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about the dust starting to blow again,\u201d Shroyer said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard people say that with our current farming techniques we\u2019ll never have a Dust Bowl again. That\u2019s a bold statement.\u201d\nNo one is pointing to a return to the poverty of the 1930s. Along with crop insurance and emergency subsidies made available because of the drought, U.S. farmers have been transformed from subsistence growers to global suppliers. About 20 percent of the labor force worked in farming then, compared with less than 2 percent today, according to U.S. Census data.\nStockpiles Shrinking\nGlobal stockpiles may drop to a five-year low, Goldman analysts led by New York-based Jeff Currie said in a report Aug. 7. If production in the former members of the Soviet Union falls too low, Russia and Ukraine may impose export restrictions as they did in 2010, they said.\nWheat rallied 47 percent that year, contributing to a jump in food costs that reached a record in 2011 and helped spark riots across the Middle East and North Africa. The IGC estimates Russia will harvest 41 million tons this year, less than the 41.5 million it reaped in 2010. Rabobank expects prices to reach $9.20 in the second quarter of 2013, still 32 percent below the record of $13.495 reached in February 2008.\nRising prices boosted the cost of flour for St. Louis-based Panera Bread (PNRA) during the second quarter and reduced margins, President and Co-Chief Executive Officer William W. Moreton said on a conference call with analysts July 25. A $1 gain in wheat boosts Panera\u2019s annual costs by about $3 million, and the company expects to spend an extra $6 million on the commodity this year.\nBread Prices\nGrupo Bimbo SAB, the world\u2019s largest bread maker, will have to buy more costly wheat should current conditions persist, and that may mean raising prices for its products, Mexico City-based CEO Daniel Servitje Montull said on a conference call July 26.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve planted wheat into dry conditions in the past, but I haven\u2019t planted into conditions where we\u2019ve had an extreme dry period for this long,\u201d said Justin Knopf, a 34-year-old farmer near Salina, Kansas. \u201cWe\u2019re planning on seeding as we normally do and hoping for moisture in the next several months.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Tony C.

In October, it won approval to buy Sara Lee Corp. (SLE) \u2019s North American bakeries for $675 million and agreed to buy Sara Lee\u2019s bakery unit in Spain and Portugal for about $150 million.\nBimbo can reduce costs by requiring the factories it acquired to use the same processes as their new owner, Servitje said at the B-20 summit. That should improve profit margins in the second-half 2012 compared with 2011, he said.\n\u201cIn the long term, today we\u2019re leading players worldwide in breadmaking, and we want to continue that leadership, which implies maintaining a level of organic growth and, here and there, also important non-organic growth,\u201d Servitje said.\nBimbo\u2019s first-quarter profit margin, excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, fell to 10.5 percent from 12.2 percent a year earlier, the company said April 26.\nWheat Prices\nProfit margins were also hurt by prices for commodities such as wheat that are priced in dollars, which prompted cost increases as the peso weakened. The peso sank 9.5 percent against the dollar last month, the most among major currencies, as concern Europe \u2019s debt crisis is worsening prompted investors globally to avoid higher-yielding assets.\nWheat prices may fall as global supplies of the grain are \u201cadequate\u201d and as economic concerns cut demand, Rabobank International said today in a report.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see an environment that will continue with commodities at high prices relative to the past, but more stable compared with the recent past,\u201d Servitje said.\nWheat futures for December delivery surged 3.3 percent to $6.725 a bushel today on the Chicago Board of Trade.\nBond Sales\nAfter selling $800 million in dollar-denominated bonds in January and 5 billion pesos ($361 million) in Mexican bonds in February, Bimbo doesn\u2019t need more debt sales, Servitje said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s our intention to reduce our leverage from what we have today,\u201d he said. \u201cOur refinancing was very opportune, at good rates, and that gives us a lot of security in the company\u2019s long-term plans.\u201d\nMexican companies that are sound financially are still attracting investment in the debt market , he said.\n\u201cWhile before it was difficult to be a Latin American company, now it\u2019s an advantage,\u201d he said.\nBimbo fell 0.6 percent to 30.79 pesos at the close in Mexico City.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Crayton Harrison in Mexico City at tharrison5@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:38:07", "post_time": "2012-06-18 17:04:51", "author": "Crayton Harrison", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-18/bimbo-ceo-stops-through-2014-to-digest-after-shopping-spree-2-.html", "title": "Bimbo CEO Stops Through 2014 to Digest After Shopping Spree", "post_date": "2012-06-18", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "MEXBOL", "embers_id": "d5e14d677efb0c3c20f0558d6c7d24d5fbbc5da5"}, {"content": "Mexico Stocks: Homex, Axtel Gain; Bimbo, Soriana Decline\nBy Christine Jenkins - 2012-02-09T20:42:43Z\nThe following companies are having unusual price changes in Mexico trading.

High frequency traders use computers programs to automatically execute fast-paced trading strategies.\nThe new trading engine itself, known as MoNet, operated without incident yesterday, Ibarra said.\nMoNet is about 300-times faster than its predecessor, with the capacity to handle handle about 100,000 transactions per second, according to a presentation distributed to journalists on Sept. 11.

Levin - 2012-05-31T21:46:22Z\nBolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB \u2019s Chief Executive Officer Luis Tellez said he doubts there will be more initial public offerings this year as Europe \u2019s debt crisis saps demand for emerging-market assets.\nCorp. Inmobiliaria Vesta SAB, the latest Mexican company that filed to list shares, \u201cbasically decided not to go out because of the markets,\u201d Tellez said in an interview at a pension fund conference in Cancun. Vesta hired Credit Suisse Group AG and Banco Santander SA (SAN) to arrange the deal.\n\u201cI\u2019m a little bit skeptical that something will happen in the rest of the year,\u201d Tellez said. \u201cI\u2019ve been very skeptical about the way Europe is going.\u201d\nWhile Mexico has a pipeline of about 10 companies considering selling shares, the market has been dormant since petrochemicals producer Alpek SAB (ALPEKA) went public last month, snapping a nine-month lull, Tellez said. Alpek priced at the bottom of a range provided in the prospectus.\nAlpek\u2019s IPO was the first since July, when lender Banregio Grupo Financiero SAB raised 1.8 billion pesos. OHL Mexico SAB, the construction company that did Mexico\u2019s biggest IPO when it sold shares in 2010, has lost 37 percent since the listing.\nStill, Tellez said he\u2019s optimistic that Mexico\u2019s next president may initiate changes needed to bring state-owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos to the stock market, a potential watershed moment for the exchange and an oil industry that has been under government control since it was nationalized in 1938.\n\u2018Realistic Probability\u2019\n\u201cThere\u2019s a realistic probability of it happening\u201d during the next government, Tellez said. \u201cIf the president does it from the very beginning, it would clearly create a very interesting climate in terms of saying, \u2018Things are changing for Mexico .\u2019\u201d\nEnrique Pena Nieto, the frontrunner in polls before the July 1 vote, says he\u2019ll seek to open the industry to private investment.\nTellez also said he expects the exchange\u2019s derivatives business to pick up, with revenue increasing \u201cat least\u201d 50 percent. Pending regulatory changes that will require over-the- counter derivatives to pass through a clearing house will bolster revenue, Tellez said.\nMexico\u2019s National Banking and Securities Commission is working on the new rules to comply with Group of 20 guidelines and expects to finish them by year-end, spokesman Carlos Lopez- Moctezuma said in a May 22 e-mailed response to questions. The changes don\u2019t require congressional approval, Lopez-Moctezuma said.\n\u2018Very Competitive\u2019\nWhile Bolsa Mexicana is the country\u2019s only exchange, it would have to compete with other clearing houses abroad when transactions involve a non-Mexican counterparty, according to Tellez.\n\u201cIt would increase our business,\u201d Tellez said. \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic that we will be very competitive. We will be attracting some of the business which is done with one leg in Mexico and one leg outside Mexico.\u201d\nAbout 20 percent to 25 percent of the country\u2019s derivatives transactions are between two Mexican parties while the rest involve a foreign counterparty, Tellez said.\nBolsa Mexicana plans to announce a new head of strategic planning next week to replace Javier Artigas, Tellez said. Artigas left the exchange this month to become country head in Mexico for Sao Paulo-based Banco BTG Pactual SA.\nThe exchange has interviewed five candidates to replace him, according to Tellez.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jonathan J.

Levin and Serena Saitto - 2012-09-07T20:34:43Z\nCemex SAB (CEMEXCPO) hired Citigroup Inc. (C) , Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) and Banco Santander SA (SAN) to manage the initial public offering in Colombia of its Central and South America unit, according to two people familiar with the matter.\nWhile the details of the sale are still under discussion, the company may raise about $1 billion by listing the unit, known as Cemex Latam Holdings SA, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the process is private.\nCemex, the largest cement maker in the Americas, said last month that it planned to sell a minority stake in its Central and South American businesses as it seeks money to repay creditors. The Monterrey, Mexico-based company, working to halt 11 consecutive quarterly losses , must make a $1 billion payment to banks next year under a proposed new refinancing agreement.\nSpokesmen at Citigroup, Cemex, Santander and BBVA declined to comment. Cemex said Aug. 21 that it would seek to list the unit on the Colombian stock exchange and complete a private placement. The Central and South American assets don\u2019t include operations in Mexico.\nCarvajal Empaques SA and Construcciones El Condor SA are the only companies to have gone public in Colombia this year, following one IPO last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nCemex rose 1.2 percent to 10.47 pesos at the close of trading in Mexico City. The stock has soared 46 percent this year, compared with an 8 percent advance for the benchmark IPC index of 35 Mexican stocks.\nRinker Purchase\nThe cement maker\u2019s debt levels jumped after it paid $14.2 billion for Rinker Group Ltd. in 2007 to boost its presence in the U.S. market. In 2009, Cemex restructured its bank debt as the U.S. housing slump sapped demand for construction materials.\nYields on Cemex\u2019s dollar bonds due in 2020 fell 18 basis points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 9.56 percent today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. They have tumbled 137 basis points in the past month.\nCemex\u2019s sales in South America, Central America and the Caribbean rose 25 percent to $1.1 billion in the first half of the year, contributing about 14 percent of total revenue. The operating margin for the region in the first six months of the year, based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was 34.9 percent, about double Cemex\u2019s margin for all of its businesses.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jonathan J.

Her net worth is $13.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. She is the 60th-richest person in the world, and doesn\u2019t appear on any other international wealth ranking.\nFounded by her late husband Sebastiao Camargo in 1939, Camargo Correa is controlled through the Participacoes Morro Vermelho SA holding company. Morro Vermelho\u2019s shares are held in equal proportion under the names of Camargo\u2019s three daughters, Regina, Renata and Rosana. According to incorporation documents published in 2002, some of the shares were issued in lifetime usufruct in favor of Camargo, meaning she is their beneficial owner until her death. The rest can\u2019t be sold, transferred or borrowed against by her daughters.\n\u201cYou never see them in the society pages,\u201d said David Fleischer , a political analyst at the University of Brasilia, speaking about the Camargo family. \u201cThey allow professional administrators to do all the management.\u201d\nBatista, Safra\nWhen Sebastiao Camargo died in 1994, he was one of Brazil\u2019s few billionaires, renowned for his role in building dams and highways across the country after World War II. His widow\u2019s fortune has only grown since then, with Brazil pouring money into infrastructure ahead of the World Cup in 2014 and the Summer Olympics two years later. This year, the group spent almost 3 billion euros ($3.7 billion) to acquire 95 percent of Cimpor Cimentos de Portugal SGPS, a publicly traded cement maker based in Lisbon.\nA spokesman for the company confirmed that Dirce Camargo controls the family fortune, and declined to comment on her net worth. She now ranks as the third-richest person in Brazil, displacing banker Joseph Safra, who has a fortune of $10.3 billion, according to Bloomberg\u2019s daily ranking. Commodities tycoon Eike Batista remains No. 1 with $20.8 billion, followed by Anheuser-Busch InBev NV investor Jorge Paulo Lemann with $17.2 billion.\nThe Camargo family\u2019s other public holdings include 26 percent of electricity company CPFL Energia SA (CPFE3) , a stake worth $2.8 billion; a 17 percent interest in Sao Paulo-based toll-road operator CCR SA (CCRO3) , valued at $2.6 billion; and a controlling interest in footwear manufacturer Alpargatas SA (ALPA4) worth $1.1 billion. The group\u2019s flagship construction arm, which is helping to build the Belo Monte and Jirau hydroelectric dams in Brazil\u2019s Amazon region, generated about 30 percent of the group\u2019s total revenue of 17.3 billion reais ($8.6 billion) last year.\nDonkey Carts\nBorn in 1909, Sebastiao Camargo started out carting sand by donkey when he was a teenager. He opened a construction business in 1939 with two partners, whose stakes the Camargo family later bought out. They won government contracts for roads and railways over the decade that followed. In the 1950s, their company participated in the construction of Brazil\u2019s new capital, Brasilia.\nCamargo -- who was awarded an honorary diploma from the government\u2019s High College of War in 1967 -- expanded the business into cement during the two-decade military dictatorship that took power in a 1964 coup. It was a \u201cfat cow\u201d period of increased state investment, according to Fleischer. Camargo took on ever-larger infrastructure projects, including subway lines in Sao Paulo , the Trans-Amazonian Highway and the bridge connecting Rio de Janeiro and neighboring Niteroi.\n\u201cBrazil\u2019s greatest progress was in the military government,\u201d Camargo told the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper in December 1990.\nGeneral Goncalves\nIn the 1970s, Camargo pushed deeper into Latin America . General Leonidas Pires Goncalves told the Sao Paulo-based oral- history archive Museu da Pessoa that Camargo once asked him to secure the assistance of the Brazilian government to mediate a labor dispute at a project in Venezuela . Goncalves agreed. When democracy returned in 1985, the general was named minister of the army.\nCamargo\u2019s business continued to prosper under civilian rule. During the privatization wave of the 1990s, the conglomerate acquired electricity company CPFL, and won toll- road concessions that were later bundled together into publicly traded CCR. Sebastiao Camargo led the company until his death in 1994, when control passed to his wife, Dirce.\n\u201cSebastian was daring,\u201d former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said in a December 2002 address at the Tucurui dam, one of Camargo Correa\u2019s many projects. \u201cAnd the results of his daring are left in concrete in Brazil and abroad.\u201d\nToday, Camargo Correa continues to benefit from government projects. Financing from the state development bank, known as the BNDES, accounts for about 24 percent of the company\u2019s debt, according to Jose Vertiz, the director of Latin American corporate finance at Fitch Ratings . The conglomerate operates in 17 countries and employs 58,400 people.\nCement, Shipbuilding\nDirce Camargo briefly acted as chairman after her husband\u2019s death. The company is now led by professional administrators, including Chairman Vitor Hallack. The husbands of two of the founder\u2019s daughters sit on the board: Carlos Pires Oliveira and Luiz Roberto Ortiz Nascimento. The third, Fernando Arruda Botelho, died in an airplane crash in April.\nAfter the conglomerate\u2019s $9.5 billion in public holdings, its construction operation is its largest asset. The unit posted 5.2 billion reais in revenue and 166 million reais in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization last year, according to the company\u2019s annual report. The division is valued at $2.2 billion based on the average enterprise value-to-sales and enterprise value-to-Ebitda multiples of four publicly traded peers: Peru\u2019s Grana & Montero SAA, Chile\u2019s Besalco SA (BESALCO) , China State Construction International Holdings Ltd. and Dubai-based Arabtec Holding Co.\nGolf Courses\nLeaving out publicly traded Cimpor, Camargo Correa posted 1.1 billion reais in cement sales last year. Based on the average enterprise value-to-sales multiple of Cimpor and four peers -- Colombia\u2019s Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS) , Mexico\u2019s Cemex SAB, PT Holcim Indonesia and Mumbai-based Ultratech Cement Ltd. (UTCEM) -- the closely held slice of the cement division is valued at $1.3 billion.\nThe group\u2019s shipbuilding operations posted 609 million reais in revenue, negative Ebitda of 449 million reais and a loss of 188 million reais last year. The division is valued at $265 million based on the average enterprise value-to-sales multiple of four Singaporean shipyard owners: Nam Cheong Ltd., JES International Holdings Ltd., Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Holdings Ltd. and STX OSV Holdings Ltd. (SOH)\nPolitical Donations\nA 5 percent liquidity discount was applied to each of the company\u2019s closely held units. A liability of $3.2 billion was added to Camargo Correa\u2019s balance sheet to reflect the conglomerate\u2019s closely held net debt, as estimated in a June 2012 report by Fitch\u2019s Vertiz.\nCamargo Correa has reported more than $4.2 billion in net income in the past decade, according to its annual reports. Based on the company\u2019s statutory dividend of 15 percent of net income, and adjusting for estimated market performance and lifestyle costs, the family probably holds more than $3 billion in cash, real estate and other outside assets, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index . Included in those holdings are multiple golf courses near Sao Paulo, as reported by the magazine Veja in July 2002.

Cemex also made money in the U.S. for the first time in eight quarters, earning $27 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure of cash flow known as Ebitda.\n\u201cWe are very positive on the evolution of the market in the U.S. -- finally, after so many years,\u201d said Fernando Gonzalez , Cemex\u2019s chief financial officer, on a conference call with analysts and investors.\nCemex has reported 11 straight quarterly net losses, having suffered during a U.S. construction recession after the $14.2 billion acquisition in 2007 of Rinker Group Ltd., which generated more than 80 percent of its sales in the U.S. During 2010, 2011 and the first three months of this year, the U.S. was the company\u2019s only regional market that lost money in Ebitda terms.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go in the U.S., but it finally returned to positive territory,\u201d said Esteban Polidura, an analyst at Deutsche Bank in Mexico City, who has a buy rating on Cemex shares. \u201cIf this trend is confirmed in the third quarter, there could be an upside surprise.\u201d\nCemex rose 5.9 percent to 9.47 pesos in Mexico City yesterday, its highest close since April 4. The stock has gained 32 percent this year, the 10th-best performance on the IPC index of 35 Mexican stocks.\nEuropean Weakness\nThe cement maker\u2019s second-quarter net loss narrowed to $187 million from a $209 million loss in the same period a year ago. Sales of $3.86 billion fell 7.2 percent from a year earlier and trailed the $4.1 billion median estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\nRevenue climbed 20 percent to $529 million in South America , Central America and the Caribbean, while falling 14 percent in Mexico, dragged down in part by lower-than-expected infrastructure spending. Sales dropped 18 percent in Northern Europe and 20 percent in the Mediterranean region.\nWhile Cemex said more infrastructure spending later this year or next year may fuel Mexican sales, a weaker outlook in Europe makes the company\u2019s near-term performance \u201ca levered bet on U.S. recovery,\u201d said Andrew Casella, an analyst with Imperial Capital LLC, who has an underperform rating on the shares.\nCalifornia, Texas\nCasella said Cemex must boost sales in order to drive additional gains in Ebitda, which rose 11 percent to $702 million in the second quarter. That was the highest level since the third quarter of 2009, buoyed in part by job cuts over the last year and lower energy prices.\n\u201cYou need the U.S. to have a very robust recovery, you need Colombia and Panama to continue to do what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Casella said in a telephone interview from New York . \u201cThe weakness in Europe is pretty substantial.\u201d\nThe sales declines in Europe came a year after a strong performance there, said Maher Al-Haffar, Cemex\u2019s chief of communications and investor relations. The company\u2019s Northern European markets are likely to show \u201cflat to muted growth\u201d in the second half of the year, he said, while the Spanish business will probably show continued declines.\nDriving Cemex\u2019s U.S. rebound were sales in California and Texas , Gonzalez said. In a conference call with reporters, he said he saw a \u201csustained recovery since July or August of last year.\u201d\nDebt Load\nContinued gains would help Cemex work off its debt, which totaled $17.6 billion including perpetual notes as of June 30, down 4.3 percent from its level a year earlier. U.S. sales peaked at $1.7 billion in the third quarter of 2007, more than twice the amount in the second quarter of this year.\nCemex\u2019s credit rating was cut seven levels by Standard & Poor\u2019s over a 10-month span ended in August 2009 after the company added debt to pay for the Rinker acquisition. Cemex bonds have rallied since it said June 25 that it was negotiating with banks to extend the maturity of $7.25 billion of loans. A refinancing offer announced July 5 will expire on Aug. 20.\n\u201cWe\u2019re quite pleased with the support and response we\u2019ve been getting from all the financing participants,\u201d Al-Haffar said. \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic that come Aug. 20, we\u2019ll be able to close on that.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Brendan Case in Mexico City at bcase4@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Ed Dufner at edufner@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:39:08", "post_time": "2012-07-21 00:01:00", "author": "Brendan Case", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-21/cemex-bolstered-by-u-s-as-sales-fall-in-europe-mexico.html", "title": "Cemex Bolstered by U.S. as Sales Fall in Europe, Mexico", "post_date": "2012-07-21", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "MEXBOL", "embers_id": "18aa3fd5a312eaa0b00bf5a18f93a3aa68fd8ca9"}, {"content": "Cemex Net Loss Narrows in Second Quarter as U.S. Sales Rise\nBy Brendan Case - 2012-07-20T11:53:21Z\nCemex SAB (CX) , the largest cement maker in the Americas, said its second-quarter net loss narrowed as sales rose in the U.S.\nThe net loss for the three months ended June 30 shrank to $187 million from $209 million in the same period last year, Cemex said today in a statement.\nRevenue was $3.86 billion, down 7 percent from a year earlier and less than the $4.1 billion median estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

He said he is considering entering the U.S. market with loans and \u201cmicro-insurance\u201d plans, such as paying $10 a week for a $5,000 life-insurance policy, to serve those now \u201cunbanked.\u201d\n\u201cThat would be my dream to set up a series of 10,000 branches over the U.S. that addressed the bottom of the pyramid,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated because of the environment, but we\u2019re looking at it.\u201d\nSalinas, 56, has used loans of an average size of $400 to build Mexico\u2019s 10th-largest bank measured by credit portfolio, according to government statistics . Banco Azteca, started by Salinas in 2002 as a unit of the retailer his grandfather founded, has 12 million loan accounts across Latin America .\nState and federal regulations make it difficult to enter the U.S., Salinas said. He said he isn\u2019t interested in buying a U.S. bank and would prefer to start from scratch in the country.\nInterest Rates\nBanco Azteca charges interest rates high enough that customers in some cases end up paying double the amount of the original loan over its full term, Salinas said. That\u2019s necessary to cover the costs of offering the loans, since the bank\u2019s more than 8,000 loan officers have to determine credit quality and collect interest payments, sometimes following up on delinquent clients with personal visits, he said.\nWithout higher interest rates, Banco Azteca wouldn\u2019t be able to offer loans to poor people, he said. He said he didn\u2019t have a figure for the bank\u2019s average interest rate, and company officials said they couldn\u2019t immediately provide a figure.\n\u201cLots of people who like to help the less fortunate group of people at the bottom of the pyramid think that by regulating interest rates they\u2019re going to do that, but it\u2019s exactly counterproductive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bottom of the pyramid is much better served by giving access to credit than by cutting.\u201d\nLoans for Women\nBanco Azteca, based in Mexico City, began about a year ago making loans to groups of women to help them finance businesses such as a dance studio or a restaurant, he said. The bank signed up 400,000 women for the program in its first year and expects to have 1.5 million next year, he said.\nSalinas also said he is in talks to take the microlending business to Colombia . Grupo Elektra is seeking to obtain a banking license from Colombian regulators after the government eased regulations on lending, Salinas said. Assuming the license requirements fit Mexico City-based Elektra\u2019s plans, it will begin opening banks and stores in the Andean nation, he said.\n\u201cColombia is a credit-starved country,\u201d Salinas said. \u201cThere are millions of small business owners and women who need working capital in the form of small loans.\u201d\nSalinas is making his first foray into Colombia with a telecommunications project. His TV Azteca SAB and Grupo Iusacell SA won a joint bid Nov. 4 for a $218 million project to extend fiber-optic lines to more than 700 Colombian towns. The companies beat a group led by ZTE Corp. (000063) for the bid, for which rivals America Movil SAB (AMXL) and Telefonica SA (TEF) were disqualified.\nSlim Battle\nThe project opens up a new front in Salinas\u2019s battle with Carlos Slim , America Movil \u2019s controlling shareholder and the world\u2019s richest person according to Forbes magazine. Salinas was listed as No. 112 on the magazine\u2019s billionaire list in March with a net worth of $8.2 billion.\nIusacell, Mexico\u2019s third-largest wireless carrier, has struggled to gain ground on America Movil and Telefonica and has less than 5 percent of the country\u2019s wireless subscribers. Salinas\u2019s plan to sell a 50 percent stake in Iusacell to Grupo Televisa SA for $1.6 billion will give the company the funds it needs to boost market share to as much as 15 percent, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge breath of fresh air to the company,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we need to do is give better service than the competition does.\u201d\nHurting Competition\nSlim is hurting competition in Mexico by offering lower rates for his clients to call each other than to call users of rival carriers, Salinas said. Since America Movil has the biggest network, with 70 percent of Mexican subscribers, those discounts make its service more attractive, he said.\n\u201cWe have some advantages over the Iusacell network, which have to do with technology, coverage and distribution,\u201d said Alejandro Cantu, America Movil\u2019s general counsel, in a phone interview today. \u201cThey have to compete in the street, not with statements.\u201d\nAmerica Movil\u2019s Mexico unit does offer a plan with the same rate for wireless calls in and outside its network, Cantu said.\nThe Iusacell transaction, which awaits antitrust approval, puts Salinas together with the biggest rival of his broadcasting company, TV Azteca. Televisa controls about 70 percent of Mexico\u2019s broadcast market, with TV Azteca holding much of the rest. Salinas acquired TV Azteca from Mexico\u2019s government in a 1993 privatization sale.\nAntitrust regulators shouldn\u2019t object to the Iusacell deal even though TV Azteca competes with Televisa, Salinas said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never find an interest between TV Azteca and Iusacell,\u201d he said. \u201cI happen to be a major stockholder in both of them, but I have different partners.\u201d\nIn addition to geographical expansion, Salinas is moving into new industries. Banco Azteca has built a $1 billion portfolio of investments in mining and alternative energy production, he said. The investments include a wind farm in Mexico\u2019s Chiapas state, geothermal and mini-hydroelectric projects, he said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Crayton Harrison in Mexico City at tharrison5@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net\nBillionaire Salinas Studying U.S. Expansion to Target\nJoshua Lott/Bloomberg\nRicardo Salinas Pliego, president and chief executive officer of Grupo Salinas and Grupo Elektra, speaks during the Society of American Business and Writers Conference at Arizona State University in Phoenix.\nRicardo Salinas Pliego, president and chief executive officer of Grupo Salinas and Grupo Elektra, speaks during the Society of American Business and Writers Conference at Arizona State University in Phoenix.

Levin - 2012-04-16T20:48:59Z\nBulltick Capital Markets \u2019s brokerage in Mexico was suspended from the stock exchange after sparking a market collapse by making what regulators said may be the worst trading mistake in the country\u2019s history.\nThe IPC gauge of Mexican shares sank 2 percent in about three minutes starting at 2:45 p.m. local time on April 13, according to prices provided that day. The bourse has canceled the trades, which it said affected 13 companies.\n\u201cWhat happened is extremely serious and it\u2019s not acceptable for these things to occur,\u201d Guillermo Babatz, president of the National Banking and Securities Commission, said in a telephone interview today from Mexico City. \u201cMy impression is that this is the most significant erroneous trade in the history of the market.\u201d\nThe Bulltick-triggered collapse is the latest example of financial-market technology sparking market disruptions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly lost almost 1,000 points in the \u201cflash crash\u201d of May 6, 2010. Last month, Bats Global Markets Inc. canceled its initial public offering after a computer malfunction kept the Lenexa, Kansas, company from trading on its own platform and forced a halt in Apple Inc.\nReview of Bulltick\nOfficials from the Mexican stock exchange and the National Banking and Securities Commission are visiting Bulltick\u2019s brokerage today to review its systems, Alejandro Creixell, a managing partner at the firm, said today in a phone interview.\nMexico should seek a tool to identify when transaction sizes and prices are unusual, according to Babatz. The exchange\u2019s circuit breaker mechanisms, which were strengthened in the wake of the U.S. flash crash, succeeded in preventing a deeper crisis, Babatz said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what additional steps the authorities can take to prevent this type of thing,\u201d Carlos Hermosillo , an analyst at Grupo Financiero Banorte-Ixe in Mexico City, said in a telephone interview. Last week\u2019s plunge shows there are \u201choles\u201d in the Bolsa\u2019s maintenance of orderly trading, Hermosillo said.\nThe IPC had ended April 13 down 2.3 percent following the Bulltick errors. The benchmark gauge lost 0.6 percent for the day after the trades were voided. The index fell 0.2 percent at 3:07 p.m. today in Mexico City. Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB, the operator of the exchange, increased 1.4 percent.\nSell Orders\nBulltick\u2019s Mexico brokerage executed more sell orders by volume than any other Mexican brokerage on April 13. In the previous month, Bulltick was the 19st-most-active seller, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u201cEight thousand basket orders got away from us with the wrong price,\u201d Creixell said. \u201cThe system wasn\u2019t configured to stop the orders by price but by volume. That was the problem.\u201d\nBats priced 6.3 million shares on March 22 and was ready to begin trading a day later when one of its computers malfunctioned, triggering events that ended with the IPO\u2019s cancellation. The \u201cflash crash\u201d almost two years ago erased $862 billion from stock values in less than 20 minutes.\nMiami Firm\nBulltick, a Miami-based investment firm that specializes in Latin America , entered the Mexican market as a brokerage in July 2008.\nThe Mexican exchange has been implementing technology to allow transactions to be executed more quickly. High-frequency trading, which uses programs to execute transactions more quickly, accounts for about 20 percent of cash equities transactions on the Mexican exchange, Javier Artigas, head of strategic planning for the exchange operator, said on a Feb. 22 conference call.\nTechnology in the testing phase at the exchange will give the exchange the capacity to process 200,000 transactions per second, according to a transcript of the call.\n\u201cIf they hadn\u2019t canceled the operations, it would have been catastrophic,\u201d said Jorge Lagunas, who oversees about $200 million as a money manager at Mexico City-based Grupo Financiero Interacciones SA. \u201cThe Bolsa made the right decision.

He declined to project when Bulltick may get permission to renew operations.\n\u201cThis is very similar to what happened in the flash crash of May 2010,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely clear that it was a technological error that could happen to anyone.

Notes from Desarrolladora Homex SAB, Mexico\u2019s biggest homebuilder, also dropped.\nAlma Beltran, a press official with Urbi, said the company isn\u2019t engaged in restructuring talks while it pursues a plan to scale back growth over the next six quarters and reverse the negative free cash flow it reported in the second quarter.

Levin - 2012-03-12T21:00:13Z\nSare Holding SAB (SAREB) , the builder offering $1.4 million condominiums on the Pacific coast beach of Acapulco, is struggling to sustain sales and share prices amid increasing bloodshed from Mexican drug cartels.\nRevenue in Acapulco, Sare\u2019s one-time biggest market, dried up completely in the fourth quarter, dragging full-year home sales in the city down 54 percent to 330.2 million pesos ($26 million), according to a Feb. 27 report and additional figures provided by the company. Security concerns were among the biggest obstacles to growth , with its home sales nationwide plunging 90 percent, the company said.\nWith the Mexican mortgage industry struggling to recover from an economic contraction three years ago, Acapulco\u2019s gangland killings are exacerbating the slump in a city already losing its luster to resorts in the Mexican Caribbean. Violence intensified last year as cartels jockeyed for control of cocaine shipment routes to the U.S.\nConsumers \u201chave the security issue on their minds,\u201d said Jorge Placido, the Mexico City-based head of equity analysis at Vector Casa de Bolsa SA, the brokerage that executed the most sell orders of Sare stock on the day its earnings report sparked a 7.4 percent plunge. Buyers want vacation homes \u201cthat offer peace and security,\u201d he said.\nThe value of new commercial bank mortgages in Guerrero, the state whose biggest city is Acapulco, fell 16 percent to 922.5 million pesos last year from 2008, before the U.S. recession spread to its southern neighbor. The contraction in Guerrero\u2019s market was steeper and the recovery has been slower than the rest of the country, where mortgage lending is down 2.2 percent from 2008, according to data compiled by the local unit of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA. (BBVA)\nWorst Performer\nSare stock has tumbled 14.2 percent since the earnings, making it the worst performer on the country\u2019s IRT small capitalization (IRTSMALL) index of 20 Mexican companies. It fell 1.4 percent to 1.39 pesos at 2 p.m. Mexico City time.\nThe company had to halt land sales from October to February and construction financing was temporarily suspended as it negotiated changes to its bank debt , it said in its quarterly report. Sare last month extended maturities on about 2.4 billion pesos of loans to an average of five years, from a range of about one to four years.\nSare posted a fourth-quarter loss of 180.2 million pesos. The full-year loss was 117.9 million pesos.\n\u201cThe perception of insecurity set back our sales,\u201d investor relations official Mauricio Suarez said in a March 5 telephone interview from Mexico City. \u201cUnits didn\u2019t move like we were expecting.\u201d\nGuerrero Homicides\nHomicides in Guerrero rose 44 percent to 2,158 in 2011. In August, the state\u2019s monthly tally briefly surpassed Chihuahua to make it the most dangerous territory in Mexico, according to data compiled by the attorney general\u2019s office. A separate measure provided by the head prosecutor, which tracks drug-war violence specifically though only counts through September, shows most of the killings were drug related.\nThe arrest on Aug. 30, 2010, of Edgar Valdez Villareal, who the government says was a boss for the Beltran Leyva gang, spawned battles among splinter cartels vying for the alleged kingpin\u2019s old territory, according to police. The U.S. had a $2 million reward out for the capture of the Laredo, Texas-born former high school football star nicknamed \u201cLa Barbie,\u201d a reference to his blonde hair and light complexion.\n\u201cThey are obliged to make such statements,\u201d Kent Schaffer , a U.S.-based attorney for Valdez Villareal, said March 9 in an e-mailed response to questions. \u201cWe deny their allegations.\u201d\nDispatching Military\nPresident Felipe Calderon dispatched the military and federal police on Oct. 6 to patrol the region\u2019s streets in an operation known as Secure Guerrero. While homicides were down 19 percent in February from September, they\u2019re still above 2010 levels. Interior Minister Alejandro Poire said Jan. 25 that the offensive has led to \u201csignificant advances\u201d in curbing crime.\nThe underperformance of the local mortgage market reflects the combined effect of violence with other factors, including the sluggish U.S. recovery that\u2019s hurting the wallets of foreign buyers, said Eduardo Torres, an economist tracking the real- estate industry for the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria unit, known as BBVA Bancomer. Preferences among wealthy Mexicans may also be shifting regarding where they build their second homes, he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a combination of elements that go beyond just the violence,\u201d Torres said in a telephone interview from Mexico City. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue of income as well as perception.\u201d\nThe U.S. economy will grow 2.2 percent in 2012, up from 1.7 percent in 2011, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 79 economists.\nMarble Jacuzzis\nAt Marena, the Sare\u2019s top-of-the-line development in the beach city, condos sell for an average of 18 million pesos and come with marble Jacuzzis on private terraces. The in-house spa offers hot-stone massages.\nAcross Mexico, drug-related violence has killed at least 47,500 people since December 2006, when Calderon took office. The government projected in 2010 that drug-related violence shaves 1.2 percentage points off GDP annually. The Finance Ministry declined requests to provide an updated estimate.\nEconomic growth will slow to 3.2 percent this year, from 3.9 percent in 2011, according to the median of 15 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any evidence that the violence is having any impact on the housing sector,\u201d Ariel Cano, director of the government\u2019s National Housing Commission, said in an interview in New York March 8. \u201cFor sure it\u2019s not helping.\u201d\nPoised for Recovery\nSare is betting that with debt talks behind it, the company is poised for a recovery. Horacio Espinosa de los Monteros, who the board named chief executive effective March 1, said revenue may climb to a range of 2.1 billion to 2.4 billion pesos in 2012, up from 1.6 billion pesos in 2011. About half will come from land sales, while the other 1.1 billion to 1.4 billion pesos will come from the company\u2019s core business, he said.\nThe builder also plans to shift its focus to the low-income market, which benefits from government subsidy programs aimed at curbing a housing deficit that leaves about 8.9 million families either without homes or living in substandard dwellings.\nJorge Lagunas, who oversees about $200 million as a money manager at Mexico City-based Grupo Financiero Interacciones SA, said he\u2019s seen some demand for Sare shares from investors looking to more than double their money.\n\u201cThe company isn\u2019t going bust,\u201d he said in a telephone interview from Mexico City. His bank gives Sare as an option \u201conly for the class of clients whose investment profile is very high-risk.\u201d\nAvoid Areas\nThe U.S. Department of State said visitors should take the Mexico City-Acapulco highway only during daylight hours and, once in the coastal city, avoid areas more than two blocks inland from the main promenade, Costera Miguel Aleman, according to a Feb. 8 travel warning .\nForeign passenger traffic to Acapulco\u2019s airport, operated by Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte SAB , fell 53 percent in February from a year earlier, the Apodaca, Mexico-based company said in a March 7 statement to the stock exchange.\nJobs registered in the state with the social security institute, which excludes informal workers such as street vendors from its count, have fallen 3.1 percent during Calderon\u2019s administration, compared to a 9.8 percent increase across Mexico.\nSare should steer clear of Guerrero as it retools its investment strategy, said Carlos Hermosillo , an analyst at Grupo Financiero Banorte-Ixe in Mexico City. It\u2019s already planning to sell some land purchased for its Solar Villas project in Acapulco, the investor relations officer Suarez said.\nThe crime escalation is \u201cnot something that will be resolved in six month or a year,\u201d Hermosillo said in a telephone interview. \u201cWill they eventually return -- in two years, or five, or 10? Who knows?\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jonathan J.

Kaloo\u2019s preference for companies with lower debt and higher profitability than the benchmark index helped the fund post smaller price swings than 77 percent of peers in a period when emerging-market volatility reached a record high.\nKaloo, 40, won with businesses that accelerated profit growth despite a global slowdown and a 4.5 percent decline in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index in the past year, including reinvested dividends. While competitors got hurt by bets on bank and energy stocks, which tend to drop most in falling markets, the Aberdeen manager\u2019s picks in those industries rallied. They include Mexican lender Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB (GFNORTEO) and Tenaris SA (TEN) , a maker of seamless pipes that has benefited from oil exploration in Mexico and Brazil, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always looking for returns per unit of risk, and theirs are impressive,\u201d said Sam Katzman, the chief investment officer for New York-based Constellation Wealth Advisors, which has about $50 million invested in the Aberdeen Emerging Markets fund. Stock selection spurred the outperformance, said Katzman, whose firm manages about $4.5 billion in total.\nVirtus, Oppenheimer\nThe risk-adjusted return, which isn\u2019t annualized, is calculated by dividing total return by volatility, or the degree of daily price variation, giving a measure of income per unit of risk. A higher volatility means the price of an asset can swing dramatically in a short period, increasing the potential for unexpected losses.\nThe Aberdeen fund had a total return of 49 percent in the five years through Aug. 31, the biggest gain among those in the Bloomberg ranking, with below-average volatility.\nThe $5.1 billion Virtus Emerging Markets Opportunities Fund, run by Rajiv Jain, returned 33 percent since August 2007 for the second-best performance after Kaloo\u2019s fund, while Justin Leverenz\u2019s $26 billion Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund (ODMAX) came in third with a 23 percent advance. The funds also had the No. 2 and No. 3 rankings after adjusting for price swings.\nBeating Mobius\nThe $2.8 billion Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX) , run by Robert von Rekowsky, ranked last for total return over five years after declining 21 percent and had the 10th-highest volatility. The Templeton Developing Markets Trust, overseen byMobius, declined 8.3 percent to rank 20th in the group of 27 funds, with the eighth-lowest volatility.\n\u201cVolatility and market factors have been difficult but we remain focused on bottom-up stock selection and evaluating companies based on fundamental analysis,\u201d Sophie Launay, a spokeswoman for Boston-based Fidelity, said in an e-mailed statement.\nMatthew Walsh , a spokesman for San Mateo, California-based Franklin, the manager of the Franklin and Templeton mutual funds, declined to comment.\nThe Aberdeen fund\u2019s results stand out after the MSCI Emerging Markets gauge declined 1.2 percent including dividends during the past five years. The index tumbled 66 percent from its October 2007 peak through its bear-market nadir in October 2008, then more than doubled the following two years.\nThe gauge\u2019s 100-day historical volatility has averaged 24 percent during the past five years, compared with a historical mean of 17 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It rose to a record above 60 percent during the height of the global financial crisis in January 2009.\n\u2018Excess Return\u2019\n\u201cAberdeen is an example of a fund that has historically taken on less risk than the benchmark while proving to generate excess return,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth , a mutual-fund analyst at S&P Capital IQ, a New York-based research firm.\nKaloo\u2019s returns have fueled a more than 60-fold surge in assets at the U.S.-domiciled fund in the past five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Emerging-market stock funds tracked by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based research firm EPFR Global increased assets by 27 percent in the same period.\nGrowth in the Aberdeen fund\u2019s assets may curb returns by forcing the fund managers to buy more stocks than they want to, according to S&P\u2019s Rosenbluth. It\u2019s more difficult for larger funds to purchase and sell thinly-traded stocks without affecting the market price.\n\u201cWhen a fund is investing in more illiquid markets like emerging markets, you don\u2019t want to lose your ability to be nimble,\u201d Rosenbluth said.\nFlows of investor cash have been so big that Aberdeen stopped marketing the fund to potential clients, according to James Thorneley, a spokesman for the firm. Kaloo wasn\u2019t available to comment, Thorneley said.\nFund Holdings\nKaloo, the head of global emerging markets equities at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN) , leads a team of 12 investment managers and analysts in London while also working with the firm\u2019s staff in Asia and Latin America to pick stocks for the fund, according to Aberdeen\u2019s website. The University of St Andrews graduate joined Aberdeen in February 2000 after working for Martin Currie , an Edinburgh-based money manager .\nAberdeen\u2019s stock-fund managers place a greater emphasis on business models, the quality of company executives and corporate governance than on economic trends or index weightings. Kaloo\u2019s fund held 64 stocks at the end of July, or 92 percent fewer than the MSCI Emerging Markets index.\nStock Selection\nThe Aberdeen fund\u2019s holdings in the banking industry, which account for about 25 percent of the portfolio, returned 5.2 percent during the past year while its energy shares, with a 16 percent weighting, gained 3.1 percent. The stock picks contributed more to the fund\u2019s outperformance compared with the MSCI index than for any of its peers, a Bloomberg analysis of publicly disclosed holdings through July shows.\nStock selections in the two industries have an outsized impact on relative performance because they have the biggest weightings in the MSCI index, making up more than 30 percent of the $7 trillion gauge\u2019s market value. They also have the highest value-at-risk, or VaR, among 24 industry groups, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nBank stocks in the MSCI index have lost 6.3 percent as a group during the past year after economic growth in China and India slowed to the weakest pace since 2009 and consumer defaults in Brazil hit a 30-month high. Oil\u2019s slide from this year\u2019s peak in February and growing supplies of natural gas have helped drag down energy stocks by 12 percent.\nAbout 68 percent of the biggest emerging-market funds had declines in their bank holdings during the past year and 86 percent posted losses from investments in energy companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nBoosting Banorte\nBanorte, the Monterrey, Mexico-based bank, has surged 45 percent during the past year. The bank reported earnings growth of at least 20 percent for five straight quarters as the bank boosted business, credit card and payroll lending. The lender\u2019s second-quarter earnings gain of 29 percent compares with a 10 percent combined increase for banks in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) , data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nThe Aberdeen fund boosted holdings of Banorte during the past year to 2.9 percent of the fund, and the firm is the biggest publicly-disclosed holder of the Mexico-listed shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nKaloo\u2019s fund has also benefited from holdings in Istanbul- based Akbank TAS (AKBNK) and Manila-based Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) , which both returned more than 10 percent in the past 12 months, the data show.\nTenaris Stake\nTenaris, the world\u2019s largest maker of seamless pipes, has jumped 31 percent in the past year. While the Luxembourg-based company isn\u2019t a member of the MSCI Emerging Markets index, it has benefited from increased oil exploration and production in emerging markets.\nSecond-quarter earnings rose 61 percent on growing demand for pipes from energy producers, Tenaris said in an Aug. 1 statement. The company has a current ratio, or short-term assets divided by liabilities, of 2.3, compared with an industry ratio of 1.4, data compiled by Bloomberg show. A higher ratio signals Tenaris has a greater ability to repay liabilities coming due in the next year.\nAberdeen was the biggest holder of Tenaris\u2019s U.S.-listed shares as of June, with an 11 percent stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The emerging-markets fund held about 0.7 percent of the securities, the data show.\nUltrapar Surges\nUltrapar Participacoes SA (UGPA3) , a Brazilian holding company that owns the Ipiranga gas station chain, has also been a winning pick in the energy industry for the Aberdeen fund. The stock, which accounts for about 2.9 percent of the portfolio, surged 59 percent during the past year for the top gain among companies in the MSCI Emerging Markets Energy Index.\n\u201cIt only took a couple of names in the portfolio to really prime the pump,\u201d said Jeff Tjornehoj , the head of Lipper Americas research in Denver. \u201cThis fund is managed with a lot of conviction.\u201d\nThe fund\u2019s turnover ratio, a gauge of how much its positions change in a year, is lower than all 23 peers tracked by Bloomberg that provide the data. Constellation Wealth\u2019s Katzman started investing in the fund during the second half of 2009 in part because the investment team makes about 1,500 company visits a year, he said.\nThe profit margin for the portfolio\u2019s companies is about 12 percent, two percentage points higher than the benchmark index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nLess Debt\nThe companies\u2019 debt amounted to 71 percent of common equity, versus 104 percent for the MSCI gauge, the data show. The fund\u2019s value-at-risk, as measured by its potential loss during one trading day, is about 1.7 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with 1.8 percent for the MSCI emerging-market index.\n\u201cAs bottom-up stock pickers, our global allocation strategy is a function of where we can find good quality companies which are attractively valued,\u201d the fund managers wrote in their second-quarter report. \u201cThis style may lead to significant deviations from the index.\u201d\nThe Aberdeen fund\u2019s outperformance has also made its holdings increasingly expensive versus the benchmark index. The portfolio is valued at about 13 times earnings, or 15 percent higher than the MSCI gauge, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A year ago, the ratios were about equal. The Aberdeen fund also has a higher price-to-book ratio and a lower dividend yield than the index, according to Bloomberg\u2019s analysis of disclosed holdings as of July.\n\u2018Reasonable Prices\u2019\nThe fund\u2019s managers say they\u2019re still finding stocks at attractive prices, and analysts tracked by Bloomberg are predicting gains for some the fund\u2019s top holdings. Banorte may rally 13 percent in the next 12 months, according to the average of 15 analyst projections. Tenaris will probably gain 14 percent, based on the mean of 12 forecasts.\n\u201cValuations in the asset class have come off in the wake of previous sell-offs,\u201d the Aberdeen investment team wrote in its second-quarter report. \u201cThis should provide opportunities to pick up favored stocks at reasonable prices.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Michael Patterson in London at mpatterson10@bloomberg.net ; Alexis Leondis in New York at aleondis@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Christian Baumgaertel at cbaumgaertel@bloomberg.net\nAberdeen\u2019s Kaloo Tops Mobius in Emerging Stocks\nDario Pignatelli/Bloomberg\nMark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Asset Management's Emerging Markets Group.

Annual growth eased to 4.3 percent from 4.6 percent over the same period, analysts forecast. The national statistics institute will release the figures at 8 a.m. in Mexico City.\nEconomic growth in the U.S., which buys 80 percent of Mexico\u2019s exports , slowed to a 1.5 percent annual rate in the second quarter amid unemployment that has held above 8 percent for more than three years. While Mexico\u2019s expansion may have slowed from the fastest pace since 2010, growth has topped Brazil \u2019s the past four quarters. The central bank said last month that monetary policy is adequate with the economy on a positive trajectory.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a moderation in the manufacturing cycle from previous quarters,\u201d Gabriel Lozano, chief Mexico economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , said by phone from Mexico City. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we should be too worried about, and it\u2019s in line with a decrease in dynamism in the United States .\u201d\nAnnual growth will slow to 2.9 percent in the third quarter before rising to 3.1 percent in the final three months of the year, according to the median estimates in a Bloomberg survey.\nCompany Earnings\nEarnings for Mexican companies such as Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOFL) and Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX*) reflected the slowdown in demand. Homex, Mexico\u2019s largest homebuilder by sales, has cut its 2012 revenue projection, while Femsa, Latin America\u2019s biggest Coke bottler, reported second-quarter profit that trailed analysts\u2019 estimates.\nThe central bank may be limited in its ability to cut interest rates to boost growth after annual inflation breached its 2 percent to 4 percent target range in June and reached a 28-month high of 4.42 percent in July as a bird flu outbreak and drought drove up farm prices.\nMexico\u2019s central bank has kept the nation\u2019s benchmark rate at 4.5 percent since July 2009, the lowest level among major rate-setting banks in Latin America after Peru .\nCentral bank Governor Agustin Carstens said in a July 26 interview that the effects of higher food prices will be temporary and isolated, and that Mexico\u2019s stability will enable the economy to outpace Brazil\u2019s expansion in coming years.\nEasing Inflation Risk\nThe chances of a \u201csevere weakening\u201d in the global economy have caused medium-term inflation risks to abate and the growth outlook to worsen, according to the central bank\u2019s last rate decision on July 20.\nMexican exports grew 3.8 percent in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier, down from 11.6 percent in the first three months of 2012, according to the statistics institute. Oil exports fell 14 percent from a year earlier as crude prices dropped from a nine-month high in February to an eight-month low in June, according to calculations based on statistics institute data. Growth in shipments of non-auto manufactured goods slowed to 7.1 percent in the second quarter from 7.4 percent in the first, data from the agency showed.\nSigns of slowing growth haven\u2019t fazed investors in Latin America \u2019s second-largest economy. Mexico\u2019s peso has rallied 6.1 percent this year, the most among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.\nBond Yields\nThe extra yield investors demand to own Mexican government dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries dropped 63 basis points to 159 this year through yesterday, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s EMBI Global Index. The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 fell to a record low on July 20 and slid 113 basis points, or 1.13 percentage points, this year through yesterday. The nation\u2019s IPC stock index has climbed 10 percent this year, reaching an all-time high on July 27.\nMexico\u2019s economy probably will feel the impact of a global economic slowdown more in coming months as spending projects that were ramped up before the nation\u2019s July 1 presidential election came to an end, said Sergio Martin of HSBC.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a slight downturn in external demand,\u201d Martin, HSBC\u2019s chief Mexico economist, said in a telephone interview from Mexico City. \u201cWe expect this slowdown to become more drastic in the third and fourth quarter.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Eric Martin in Mexico City at emartin21@bloomberg.net ; Nacha Cattan in Mexico City at ncattan@bloomberg.net .\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Philip Sanders at psanders@bloomberg.net .\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:41:59", "post_time": "2012-08-16 01:00:00", "author": "Eric Martin , Nacha Cattan", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-16/mexican-economic-growth-probably-slowed-as-u-s-expansion-cooled.html", "title": "Mexican Economic Growth Probably Slowed as U.S. Expansion Cooled", "post_date": "2012-08-16", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "MEXBOL", "embers_id": "2e4c4ebd999992b21e892b6ffeb1dc3109e29f28"}, {"content": "Drug War Lures Mexico Firms to Jails as Foreign Rivals Stay Away\nBy Nacha Cattan and Eric Sabo - 2012-08-02T06:00:01Z\nTwo Mexican homebuilding companies are embracing the government\u2019s turn to private enterprises to help run violence-plagued prisons that has been shunned by international jail-management firms.\nThe country will open its first private prisons this year as the U.S.-backed war against drug gangs fills cells past capacity. In Central America, where a fire at an overcrowded Honduras jail killed 366 inmates in February, business groups are also pushing governments to build and run facilities.\nIt\u2019s an opportunity that global prison operators such as G4S Plc (GFS) and Corrections Corp. of America are passing up in the face of the disorder and corruption that plagues Latin American jails. That\u2019s left untested firms like Mexican builders Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX*) and Empresas ICA SAB (ICA*) with the task of bringing order to facilities the United Nations says lack basic sanitation and are plagued by \u201calarming\u201d levels of violence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say that things could get worse because the jails are so bad,\u201d said Mark Ungar, a professor at the City University of New York in Brooklyn who studies Latin American prisons. \u201cBut I can\u2019t imagine many international companies wanting to jump into this.\u201d\nOutgoing Mexican President Felipe Calderon \u2019s administration has said farming out prison construction to private companies would cut costs for such projects by 29 percent and the new jails would increase capacity for inmates by as much as 30 percent. Enrique Pena Nieto, who will succeed him in December, says he also supports private investment to expand facilities that hold 22 percent more inmates than the 180,000 they were designed to accommodate, according to a May 2011 government report.\nHonduras Blaze\nImproving security at penitentiaries took on renewed urgency following the Feb. 14 blaze in Honduras, the world\u2019s deadliest prison fire in a century. Less than a week later, 37 inmates conspired with guards to sneak out of a Mexican jail by provoking one of the nation\u2019s bloodiest prison riots, in which 44 died.\nCalderon has said that a dozen new prisons under construction, some of them private, will be completed before his term ends, helping to relieve overcrowding in 429 federal and state facilities.\nWhile Calderon\u2019s drug crackdown has led to a surge in killings -- more than 47,500 since he took office in 2006 -- Latin America\u2019s second biggest economy has proven resilient in the face of the worsening violence. Gross domestic product grew 4.6 percent in the first three months of 2012 from a year earlier, the fastest pace in six quarters and compared with Brazil\u2019s 0.8 percent expansion.\nCriminal Hotbed\nCrowded jails that serve as a hotbed for criminal activity have hampered the drug fight in Mexico and Central America. Only $24 million of a $1.6 billion U.S. anti-narcotics aid package for the region is devoted to equipment and training for the prison system. With resources already stretched, private investors are being asked to fill the void.\nCuliacan-based Homex, Mexico\u2019s biggest homebuilder by sales, said July 25 it will buy out a partner in its prison projects for 1.1 billion pesos ($80 million) after second- quarter home sales tumbled. The company plans to build two correctional facilities this year and manage services such as food, laundry and building maintenance, the company said on conference calls with investors.\n\u201cI\u2019m confident there will be more\u201d to build, said Homex\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Gerardo de Nicolas Gutierrez in an interview in New York on March 8. \u201cThe prison population will grow as the judicial system is improved.\u201d\nRevenue Contribution\nMexico City-based ICA, Mexico\u2019s largest construction company, said in a July 27 earnings report that two prison projects due for completion before October were its single- largest contributor to second quarter revenue.\nThe penitentiary projects have the potential to produce a 35 percent profit margin for companies thanks to the government\u2019s annual payment for services of 1 billion pesos per prison, Carlos Hermosillo , a Mexico City-based analyst with Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB, said in a phone interview. In return, the government gains immediate access to capital to build prisons faster than if it had to seek budget approval from congress, he said.\nThis year, shares of Homex have fallen 31 percent to 27 pesos, while ICA has risen 34 percent to 23 pesos per share.\nNatural Fit\nWhile companies that build and operate resorts and toll roads may consider it a natural fit to turn to prison construction, their lack of experience running such facilities could prove detrimental to their bottom line, said Ramon Ortiz, an analyst with Mexico City-based brokerage Corp. Actinver SAB.\n\u201cThey face a very steep learning curve,\u201d Ortiz said.\nPress officials at both ICA and Homex didn\u2019t return e-mails requesting comment.\nWhile Mexico\u2019s government will remain in charge of guarding the prisons, that\u2019s not enough to inspire confidence for London- based G4S, which runs nine jails in the U.K., Australia and South Africa.\n\u201cThe level of influence of some of the criminal gangs is extreme,\u201d Fiona Walters, a G4S Americas spokeswoman, said in a phone interview from Jupiter, Florida. \u201cTo be able to run a safe and secure prison also speaks to broader issues and some of the challenges you\u2019ve got with the cartels in some of those countries.\u201d\nG4S\u2019s shares have dropped 7.7 percent to 250 pounds this year.\nDrug Lord\nMexico\u2019s prisons are legendary for their lawlessness. Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, the nation\u2019s most-wanted drug lord, bribed guards so he could continue his extravagant lifestyle behind bars, including parties with prostitutes. He escaped in 2001 from his maximum security jail in a laundry bin.\nNashville-based Corrections Corp. (CXW) of America, the largest U.S. prison contractor, as well as its competitors Boca Raton- based Geo Group Inc. (GEO) and closely held Management & Training Corp., based in Centerville, Utah, have no plans to pursue business in Mexico or Central America, spokesmen for each company told Bloomberg.\nThis year, Corrections Corp. has risen 49 percent to $30 per share and Geo Group has climbed 39 percent to $23.\nInvesting outside of safer, developed markets would \u201cpose a lot of risks for the G4S\u2019s of this world,\u201d said Alex Magni, an equity analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)\nInvestors \u2018Nervous\u2019\n\u201cInvestors would probably get quite nervous since there\u2019s a world of opportunity where they don\u2019t have to take that sort of risk,\u201d Magni said in an interview from London.\nIn the U.S., which has the world\u2019s highest incarceration rate, about 16 percent of federal prisoners and 7 percent of state prisoners are held in private jails, the Department of Justice said in a December report.\nMore recently, sentiment has turned against private prisons as cash-strapped state governments in the U.S. question whether handing inmates over to private facilities generates the cost- savings touted by the industry.\nIn April, California said it would reclaim almost 10,000 inmates held at private facilities. Shares in Corrections Corp tumbled 8.9 percent, their biggest drop in 11 months, the day after the plan was announced by Governor Jerry Brown . In February, Florida\u2019s Senate blocked a plan to create the largest private-prison system in the U.S.\nRights Groups\nIn Mexico, some human rights groups have complained that the government is shirking its responsibility to clean up jails by turning to private companies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to wash their hands and blame someone else for human rights violations that can take place at these jails,\u201d Jose Luis Gutierrez, director of Mexico City-based Legal Assistance for Human Rights, said in a phone interview.\nThe Public Security Ministry, which oversees Mexico\u2019s prisons, did not return calls seeking comment.\nCentral America may also follow Mexico\u2019s lead in turning its prisons over to private hands.

(ICA*)\nEconomic growth and financial stability could help Mexico boost infrastructure investment by as much as two percentage points of gross domestic product, from the current level of $45 billion to $50 billion a year, Quintana said today in an interview after participating in a Bloomberg CEO Roundtable in Mexico City.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in the range of about 4.5 to 5 percent of GDP these past years, it\u2019s been quite good actually,\u201d Quintana said. \u201cI think we can go to $70 billion a year of investment in infrastructure.\u201d\nExpectations of heightened spending on construction have fueled a 43 percent gain in ICA\u2019s stock price this year through Sept. 14, the sixth-largest gain in the IPC index of 35 Mexican stocks. ICA, the nation\u2019s largest construction company, has benefited from speculation that President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto, who takes office Dec. 1, will boost investment in infrastructure projects.\nICA rose 0.1 percent to 24.30 pesos at the close in Mexico City.\nStrategic Alternatives\nThe company, based in Mexico City, is still exploring strategic alternatives for its homebuilding unit including the sale of a majority stake, Quintana, 39, also said.\n\u201cThere could be something in the near future in terms of a possible transaction,\u201d he said. \u201cOur priority is return to shareholders and profitability.

Levin and Brendan Case - 2012-07-05T12:19:18Z\nIncoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto\u2019s vow to improve the country\u2019s highways, ports and plazas is making builder Empresas ICA SAB (ICA*) \u2019s bonds a buy to Grupo Financiero Interacciones SA and Corp. Actinver SAB.\nPena Nieto signed and notarized more than 200 pledges in cities across Mexico during the campaign, with about 75 percent of the promises focusing on infrastructure. The program, which includes plans to renovate a stretch of Acapulco, the Pacific beach resort once frequented by Frank Sinatra , will boost a construction industry already benefiting from quickening economic growth, said Alejandro Hernandez , who helps manage about $1 billion of assets at Interacciones.\nDollar bonds issued by ICA, Mexico\u2019s largest construction company, have rallied in the past month. Yields on the company\u2019s notes due 2021 dropped 73 basis points in that period to 9.78 percent, compared with a decline of 60 basis points for similarly rated corporate debt in the region, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Credit Suisse Group AG.\n\u201cThe infrastructure industry is going to grow under the new administration,\u201d Hernandez said in a phone interview from Mexico City. \u201cICA is a solid, strong company.\u201d\nICA\u2019s bonds due 2021 have returned 5.2 percent in the past month, extending this year\u2019s gain to 11.5 percent. The bonds yield 726 basis points, or 7.26 percentage points, more than similar-maturity Mexican government debt, down from 749 a month earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Standard & Poor\u2019s rates the construction company BB-, three levels below investment grade and four levels below Mexico.\nVeracruz Highway\nICA stock has rallied 23 percent in the past month to 24.78 pesos yesterday, while rival OHL Mexico SAB (OHLMEX*) added 17 percent. Promotora y Operadora de Infraestructura SAB, a Mexican toll highway operator, rallied 20 percent in the period.\nPena Nieto rolled to victory in the July 1 vote, bringing the Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI, back into power for the first time since its 71-year rule was broken in 2000. Preliminary results from the Federal Electoral Institute show Pena Nieto captured 38.2 percent of votes, compared with 31.6 percent for second-place finisher Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador , of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD.\nIn addition to fixing up Acapulco, where Sinatra and his Rat Pack hung out during the 1950s, Pena Nieto\u2019s pledges include building a passenger port in Puerto Vallarta, highways in the state of Veracruz and a dam in the state of San Luis Potosi. With a government debt burden that\u2019s less than half that of the U.S. and Germany , Pena Nieto has room in the budget to carry out his plans, according to Hernandez.\nEurope\u2019s Crisis\nPena Nieto, a 45-year-old former governor of the state of Mexico, also promised during the campaign to increase tax collection, boost formal employment and allow more private investment in the oil industry.\nEduardo Sanchez, a party spokesman, didn\u2019t respond to a phone call seeking comment.\nThe Mexican economy expanded 4.6 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2010.\nICA bonds are also gaining as investors move money back into higher-yielding assets after European leaders reached an agreement on June 29 that alleviated concern the region\u2019s banks will fail and deepen the debt crisis, said Guillermo Rodriguez , who helps manage $5.5 billion of debt at Corp. Actinver SAB.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen more demand,\u201d Rodriguez said in a telephone interview from Mexico City.\nICA\u2019s Debt\nICA\u2019s potential gains from increased spending by Pena Nieto are in part offset by a projected slide in expenditures under President Felipe Calderon until he hands over power in December, said Nuria Jorba, a credit analyst at Union Bancaire Privee. The company\u2019s rising debt levels will also limit gains in the bonds, she said.\n\u201cIt will continue to have significant leverage,\u201d Jorba said in a telephone interview from Zurich. \u201cIf the government has this program of increasing the infrastructure expansion, the company will not benefit until next year.\u201d\nICA, based in Mexico City, said in its first-quarter report that revenue growth would slow in the second half of the year because there will only be \u201ca moderate level of new contract awards\u201d during the period.\nThe company\u2019s debt increased 2 percent in the first quarter to 50.9 billion pesos ($3.8 billion) compared with the end of 2011. Net debt, or total debt minus cash, rose 4 percent as total cash fell 7 percent to 10.1 billion pesos.\nYield Spread\nThe extra yield investors demand to own Mexican government dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries rose three basis points to 201 basis points at 7:10 a.m. in Mexico City, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s EMBI Global index.\nThe peso appreciated 0.2 percent to 13.3062 per U.S. dollar . It\u2019s up 4.7 percent this year, the most among the 16 most-traded currencies.\nThe cost to protect Mexican debt against non-payment for five years rose one basis point to 126 basis points yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or cash equivalent if the issuer fails to comply with debt agreements.\nYields on Mexican interbank rate futures contracts due in December, known as TIIE, were little changed at 4.75 percent.\nInfrastructure Law\nMexico\u2019s infrastructure spending rose to an estimated 5 percent of gross domestic product last year from 3.2 percent in 2000, according to Federico Patino, the investment banking director of Banobras, a government development bank. He said a public-private partnership law, signed by Calderon earlier this year in a bid to provide greater legal security for investment, will help push infrastructure spending to at least 6 percent of GDP in the coming years.\n\u201cThe trend will continue,\u201d Patino, whose bank specializes in financing infrastructure projects, said in a telephone interview from Mexico City. \u201cWe\u2019ll see more spending by the government, but above all, we\u2019ll see more private sector participation.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jonathan J.

The company paid about 470 million euros ($581 million) in May to buy 92 percent of Wavin NV, its largest purchase as it expands overseas to diversify revenue sources. Mexichem said last month that is in talks with a unit of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Levin - 2012-07-05T20:52:41Z\nAntonio del Valle, the billionaire investor behind chemical maker Mexichem SAB\u2019s 87-fold stock rally over the past decade, said he can turn around the biggest loser in his holdings by buying companies in the fragmented chemical distribution market .\nPochteca SAB (POCHTECB) , the Mexico City-based distributor of industrial greases and solvents that lost 47 percent since 2005, will pursue acquisition-driven growth, emulating the plan that made Mexichem the second best-performing stock in Latin America over the past decade, del Valle said. He invested in a 300 million peso ($22.5 million) capital increase, equal to 20 percent of Pochteca\u2019s market value, in April after placing ex- Mexichem executives in key posts last year to strengthen the company.\n\u201cI don\u2019t just think it; I\u2019m doing it,\u201d del Valle, 73, said in a June 21 telephone interview from Mexico City. \u201cWe went all in with the capital increase,\u201d buying the maximum allowed to bring his family\u2019s personal stake to about 28 percent, he said. \u201cIt has a big future ahead of it on the Mexican stock exchange.\u201d\nPochteca has underperformed 65 percent of stocks on the nation\u2019s main small-capitalization index over the past seven years. Del Valle said hidden liabilities including debts to suppliers and unpaid taxes plagued the chemicals distributor until last year, when it produced its first annual profit under the new ownership.\nShare Rally\nThe stock has gained 53 percent since Oct. 21, when the company named Ricardo Gutierrez, an ex-Mexichem chief executive officer, as chairman of the board. The company also hired Armando Vallejo, a former head of finance at Mexichem, as chief financial officer reporting to Chief Executive Officer Armando Santacruz, who is del Valle\u2019s son-in-law.\nThe shares surged 13 percent to 2.69 pesos today, the biggest jump since May 2009.\nWith del Valle\u2019s backing, Pochteca is poised to benefit from a consolidation in Mexico \u2019s chemical distribution industry, where no company holds more than 5 percent of the market, said Fernando Perez Lizardi, an analyst with Corporativo GBM SAB, the country\u2019s largest brokerage by transactions.\n\u201cThey want Pochteca to be a repeat of the Mexichem success story,\u201d Perez Lizardi said in a telephone interview from Mexico City. \u201cThe chemical distribution market is very fragmented. That gives them a great opportunity to consolidate the market and buy different things.\u201d\nFamily Empire\nMexichem, whose decade-long rally has only been topped in the region by Sao Paulo-based Raia Drogasil SA, used acquisitions to spark 17-fold revenue growth and a near doubling in profitability over the past decade, buying more than 15 companies since 2007. This year, it forecasts revenue will grow by another 30 percent.\nThe del Valle family, led by patriarch Antonio, owned 48 percent of Mexichem as of Dec. 31, worth $3.9 billion at today\u2019s closing price of 58.34 pesos. Family members and their in-laws hold about 63 percent of Pochteca.\nDel Valle got his start in banking. He served as CEO of Grupo Financiero Bital SA before HSBC Holdings Plc purchased it in 2002. HSBC made part of the payment for the bank by turning over shares in Mexichem, then known as Grupo Industrial Camesa, giving del Valle his start in the company.\nDel Valle also owns closely held lender Grupo Financiero Ve Por Mas SA and Elementia SA, which makes copper and aluminum products and is part-owned by Carlos Slim , the world\u2019s richest man according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index . Del Valle controls all three stakes through his holding company, Grupo Empresarial Kaluz SA. He said Elementia will sell shares in an initial public offering as soon as this year.\nLow Priority\nOptimism that del Valle can turn any company he acquires into a winner has been blunted by the seven years it\u2019s taken him to prop up Pochteca shares, said Gerardo Copca , an analyst with Metanalisis SA.\n\u201cSeven years is a long time,\u201d Copca said in a telephone interview from Mexico City. \u201cWhen you buy something you have to set a time goal for when you\u2019re going to see a return on your investment.\u201d\nThe company sold 167 million pesos of shares in April in part to bolster trading in the company and lure more investors. Average daily volume was about 450,000 shares in June, double the average in April, while the portion of Pochteca\u2019s stock available to the market climbed to about 27 percent from 18 percent.\nThe company\u2019s 1.7 billion peso market capitalization equals 1.6 percent that of Mexichem, which had a value of 1.1 billion pesos when del Valle took over in 2002. Pochteca\u2019s sales were about 8.5 percent of Mexichem\u2019s in 2011.\nAztec Merchants\nThe stock\u2019s five-year slump compares with a 24 percent rally for Mexico\u2019s benchmark index in the period. The IRT Small Capitalization (IRTSMALL) index of Mexican equities added 22 percent.\nPochteca, named after a group of traveling merchants during the Aztec Empire in the 15th century, started as a paper company in 1988. In 2005, closely held Pochteca bought the publicly traded chemical distributor Dermet de Mexico and moved both businesses under the same name, eventually dropping the Dermet brand altogether.\n\u201cDermet was a mess in every single sense of the word,\u201d Pochteca\u2019s CEO Santacruz said in an April 16 interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in Mexico City. \u201cWe had quite a learning process there. We now have a pretty well-developed methodology to be able to incorporate new companies in the firm without major turbulence.\u201d\nSantacruz, 50, who earned an MBA at Harvard Business School in Cambridge, Mass., said smaller competitors are struggling to keep pace with increasing safety standards required for chemical distribution.\nKraft, Bombardier\nPochteca acquired Alcoholes Desnaturalizados y Diluentes, known as Adydsa, including its two solvent plants and 21 distribution centers, in 2008, and bought the exclusive rights to distribute Shell brand lubricants in Mexico in 2010. In April, Pochteca bought a plant to manufacture coolants and cleaning liquids under the Shell brand, and plans to buy more companies in the next year to expand its offerings and geographic reach, Santacruz said.\nThe company supplies chemicals to businesses including Bombardier Inc., the world\u2019s biggest maker of business jets , and Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT) , the second-largest food producer. Pochteca has distribution in more than 500 Mexican cities, which Santacruz says gives it \u201cthe deepest penetration\u201d in the market.\nPochteca\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure known as Ebitda, climbed 12 percent to 59 million pesos in the second quarter, according to preliminary results sent to the Mexican bourse on June 29. Sales rose 4 percent to 1 billion pesos while net debt dropped 53 percent to 260 million pesos, or 1.25 times trailing 12-month Ebitda, a record low.\n\u201cAll they have to do is focus on growth, on making the business better,\u201d del Valle said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jonathan J.

It was one of many rail orders that Spanish, Chinese and Irish bidders targeted to expand beyond Poland\u2019s 130-billion zloty ($40 billion) road-improvement program. The competition squeezed margins and business fell as the construction boom for the June European soccer championships that Poland co-hosted with Ukraine came to an end.\nThe rail unit of Budimex SA (BDX) , Poland\u2019s largest builder, filed for bankruptcy Aug. 24. According to analyst Andrzej Bernatowicz at broker IDM SA, prospects for its peers aren\u2019t good either as Europe \u2019s crisis continues to drive builders outside their home markets. Poland\u2019s transport-construction program, including 38 billion zloty for rail, is Europe\u2019s biggest, according to the Polish Infrastructure Ministry.\n\u201cThere\u2019s immense foreign competition, which includes Spanish companies as their home market shrank,\u201d said Warsaw- based Bernatowicz in a phone interview. \u201cThe pressure on margins in railway orders is already visible.\u201d\nPolimex-Mostostal SA (PXM) , Budimex\u2019s largest competitor, asked creditors July 24 for an extra four months to repay debts, while PBG SA (PBG) , Poland\u2019s third-largest builder, filed for bankruptcy June 4.\nBankruptcy Trend\nBudimex shares have lost 26 percent on the Warsaw bourse since it said it needed to write down the unit\u2019s value in June. The WIGCON Index (WIGCON) , the benchmark indicator for the construction industry, has fallen 45 percent this year as more than 100 builders went bust after losses on road contracts. The measure has declined 89 percent since its April 2007 peak, when Poland and Ukraine were named as co-hosts of the tournament.\nEighteen groups, including Spain \u2019s Obrascon Huarte Lain SA (OHL) , Grupo Dragados SA and Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas SA , bid to upgrade a 32-kilometer (20-mile) railway stretch in western Poland in February. A consortium led by Polish builder Torpol SA won the contract last month. The Polish state railway will pay 671.2 million zloty for the work, 250 million zloty less than planned, according to its website.\n\u201cI have doubts on whether conclusions have been drawn from what happened in the road construction industry,\u201d Bernatowicz said. \u201cShifting the entire risk to contractors is a problem\u201d in both road and railway building.\nEU\u2019s Fastest\nForeign builders are lured by the fastest forecast growth in the European Union. While the pace of Poland\u2019s gross domestic product declined to 2.4 percent in the second quarter from 3.5 percent in the previous period, the economy , the only one in the EU to avoid a contraction during the global crisis, will expand 2.7 percent this year, according to the median estimate of 31 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\nBudimex, a unit of Spain\u2019s Ferrovial SA (FER) , filed for the bankruptcy of its PNI Sp. z o.o. unit, citing unprofitable contracts, less than a year after it spent 225 million zloty to buy it.\nAside from building new stretches of rail, Poland spent 14 billion zloty on rail upgrades in the last five years. Both investment programs were co-funded by the EU and the bidders came from as far away as Turkey and China .\nThe competition has reduced project costs. In August 2009 GDDKiA, the country\u2019s road-building agency, said it would pay 3.2 billion zloty, or 2.5 billion zloty less than planned, for the key 91-kilometer stretch set to link Warsaw with the EU motorway network after it received 37 bids from builders.\nTournament Building\nIt\u2019s a far cry from 2010, when Poland was preparing to co- host the European Championships, the world\u2019s second-biggest soccer event after the World Cup . The EU funds were used to triple the length of Polish highways and builders were reporting record profits. The combined net income of Budimex, Polimex and PBG rose to a record 563.1 million zloty in 2010.\nBy contrast, the combined loss for the first half of this year was 2 billion zloty. Only Budimex reported a profit, of 22.1 million zloty. Their net debt stood at 3 billion zloty at the end of June, an increase from a level close to zero in 2009.\nWhile PBG, Polimex and their smaller competitor DSS SA (DSS) failed to pay back their bonds, the yields on Polish government five-year notes fell to a record low of 4.2 percent last week. The cabinet is cutting the budget deficit and investors are speculating the central bank may cut interest rates .\nChinese Cancelation\nNot all contracts with foreign companies have worked out successfully. In June last year Poland canceled a highway- building contract with China Overseas Engineering Group Co., which had experienced delays and failed to pay subcontractors. The tender it had won was at a price less than half the original budget.\nPoland\u2019s DSS SA was hired to finish the work. Then DSS went bankrupt earlier this year as building-material costs and its project-related debt jumped.\nPoland, with the most road-accident deaths of any EU country, has built 1,100 kilometers of highways since 2007, spending 85 billion zloty through last year. It plans to invest 23.2 billion zloty in 2012, with spending declining to 12.3 billion zloty next year, according to the Finance Ministry website.\nIn a country where trains travel at an average speed lower than before World War II, railway construction investments are set to more than double next year from 4.1 billion zloty planned for 2012.\nMaximum Speed\nIncreasing maximum speed on main links to 160 kilometers per hour is a top priority of the government, which spent 14 billion zloty on upgrading railroads between 2007 and 2011. That\u2019s only 37 percent of the EU funds that have to be spent by 2015, implying a pace of investment that\u2019s 50 percent slower than in other industries where EU funds are used.\n\u201cThose data are absolutely worrying,\u201d Minister for Regional Development Elzbieta Bienkowska said at a July 5 seminar on using EU funds in rail investment.\nFaster dispersion of funds could help Polish builders, said Krzysztof Pado, an analyst at BDM brokerage.\n\u201cThe construction industry is very cyclical and usually a boom comes after a wave of bankruptcies, followed by declining prices of building materials, services costs and cuts in overcapacity,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cThose who can withstand the current problems have a chance to rebound in the second half of 2013 or in early 2014, when we know what funds will be available in the next EU budget.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Marek Strzelecki in Warsaw at mstrzelecki1@bloomberg.net Maciej Martewicz at mmartewicz@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 14:44:31", "post_time": "2012-09-11 18:00:01", "author": "Marek Strzelecki , Maciej Martewicz", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-11/polish-builders-go-bust-on-rail-amid-spanish-bidding-freight.html", "title": "Polish Builders Go Bust on Rail Amid Spanish Bidding: Freight", "post_date": "2012-09-11", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "MEXBOL", "embers_id": "0f6b8ddec1060c19bbe16acd9cf3b3ed415ae626"}, {"content": "Vinci Seeks to Bid for Turkey Roads, Joining Autostrade, OHL\nBy Ercan Ersoy - 2012-09-03T16:27:07Z\nVinci SA (DG) , Europe\u2019s biggest builder, Autostrade per l\u2019Italia SpA and Obrascon Huarte Lain SA (OHL) of Spain are among companies that applied to get prequalification for a Turkish government auction for operating toll roads and Bosporus bridges.\nVinci Concessions Holding AS, the French company\u2019s Turkish unit, applied without a partner for the prequalification auction for which the deadline was today, the Ankara-based asset sale agency, known as OIB, said in an e-mailed statement.
