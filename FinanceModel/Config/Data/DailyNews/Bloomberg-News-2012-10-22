{"COLCAP": [{"content": "Crescent Point Purchases to Extend to U.S.\nBy Rebecca Penty - 2012-10-22T04:01:00Z\nCrescent Point Energy Corp. (CPG) , the most acquisitive of Canadian energy companies this year, is searching for U.S. buying opportunities as far afield as Texas to increase oil production.\nAfter spending $2 billion for smaller operators and land near the Calgary-based company\u2019s Saskatchewan and Alberta light- oil fields, Crescent Point is seeking targets to ply its \u201ctechnical expertise\u201d in the U.S. and help boost its output 44 percent by 2017, Chief Executive Officer Scott Saxberg said.\nCrescent Point employees in Denver are looking for assets across the continent, Saxberg, 44, said in an Oct. 18 interview in his Calgary office.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more opportunities than there are dollars chasing them,\u201d in the U.S., he said. \u201cIn Texas, there are more assets for sale than any other time.\u201d\nThe company, Canada\u2019s seventh-biggest oil and natural gas producer by market value, could tap equity markets for acquisition funding as oil prices have recovered since June, while not neglecting another 20 years of drilling on existing acreage, Saxberg said.\nCrescent Point\u2019s six Canadian energy purchases this year top four acquisitions by Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) and three by Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , figures compiled by Bloomberg show.\nCrescent Point\u2019s experience using horizontal drilling to discover new fields in Western Canada and coaxing oil from reservoirs with water floods give it an edge in the U.S., Saxberg said, declining to identify areas of interest.\nNorth Dakota\n\u201cWe\u2019re always looking for opportunities, so on a macro basis for our company, we\u2019re still continuing to consolidate in our main core areas and look for that new area,\u201d Saxberg said. The company plans to lift oil production , 90 percent of output, to 137,000 barrels a day in five years, from 95,000, he said.\nA North Dakota expansion could be strategic for Crescent Point, and the proximity to its Saskatchewan operations might comfort investors, said Gordon Currie of Salman Partners.\n\u201cGoing to Texas and the offshore Gulf of Mexico , that would be a stretch,\u201d Currie, an analyst who rates the company a buy and doesn\u2019t own the shares, said in a phone interview from Calgary.\nCrescent Point moved into North Dakota in 2010, acquiring more than 85,000 acres in the Bakken and Three Forks formations, according to the company\u2019s website.\nThe foothold in the state is \u201cpretty small\u201d relative to the company\u2019s position in the southeast Saskatchewan Bakken and Shaunavon in the province\u2019s west, Saxberg said. Crescent Point has kept North Dakota drilling low in a high-cost environment set to deflate as competitors slow activity, he said.\nAsset Purchases\nCrescent Point picked up Calgary-based oil and gas companies Wild Stream Exploration Inc., Cutpick Energy Inc. and Reliable Energy Ltd. and made three other asset purchases this year to expand in Western Canada , many of the deals having taken several years to develop, Saxberg said.\nThe company now controls 95 percent of the Shaunavon area and 80 percent of the Saskatchewan Bakken, he said.\nWilling investors allow Crescent Point to pay \u201chealthy prices,\u201d regularly over $100,000 a flowing barrel, Currie said. The company issued no debt to make acquisitions this year and raised about C$1.24 billion ($1.25 billion) in two equity issues.\n\u201cThey\u2019re simultaneously the most acquisition-oriented company in their peer group but also pretty liberal with equity,\u201d Currie said. \u201cThe market\u2019s pretty happy with what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\nCrescent Point rose 93 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange in the five years through Oct. 19, compared with a 17 percent drop for the Standard & Poor\u2019s/TSX Energy Index. Crescent Point has lagged this year, falling 4.7 percent, while the energy index is little changed.\nDividend Yield\nThe company has a dividend yield of 6.5 percent, and the highest rate of reinvestment among its peers, with 57 percent of dividends declared in 2011 reinvested, Currie said. It ranks No. 11 in dividend yield among companies in the index.\nAmong analysts rating the stock, 17 recommend to buy, five advise to hold and one suggests selling. Crescent Point is scheduled to release third-quarter results on Nov. 8, when it is projected to report profit excluding one-time items of C$36.2 million, or 11 Canadian cents a share, based on average analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nInvestors remain \u201cvery supportive\u201d of Crescent Point, but there\u2019s a limit to how much equity the company can issue, said Mason Granger, who manages C$500 million at Sentry Investments Inc. in Toronto, with Crescent Point as a \u201ccore\u201d holding.\n\u201cFrom time to time, I feel like there\u2019s deal fatigue,\u201d Granger said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey issue paper a lot.\u201d\n\u2018Different\u2019 Game\nTrent Stangl, a Crescent Point spokesman, didn\u2019t return a telephone call and e-mail on Oct. 19 seeking comment.\nSaxberg will probably buy in the U.S. next, with fewer large targets left in western Canada, Granger said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whole different ball game on the U.S. side and transaction multiples have been pretty high,\u201d he said. \u201cCan they make that work?\u201d\nCrescent Point\u2019s biggest challenge is \u201cnot getting too carried away,\u201d Saxberg said. \u201cNot going too fast too hard, not driving costs up and maintaining a good growth rate and a good development strategy and not overdoing it,\u201d he said.\nThe company is one of the most \u201cproactive\u201d companies in Calgary to hedge oil prices to reduce risk, Currie said. \u201cThese guys are very good about it,\u201d Currie said. \u201cThey do it two or three years out in the future.\u201d\nInvestments to connect Crescent Point\u2019s Saskatchewan fields to rail lines that began three years ago are paying off, Saxberg said.\nAs pipeline bottlenecks depressed Canadian crude prices in the second quarter, the company was making C$10 a barrel more moving oil by rail to eastern Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, he said. Crescent Point is doubling its rail capacity, a \u201csafety valve\u201d against pipeline disruptions, he said, to 45,000 barrels a day this year.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Rebecca Penty in Calgary at rpenty@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Susan Warren at susanwarren@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 09:55:40", "post_time": "2012-10-22 00:01:00", "author": "Rebecca Penty", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-22/crescent-point-purchases-to-extend-to-u-s-.html", "title": "Crescent Point Purchases to Extend to U.S.", "post_date": "2012-10-22", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "COLCAP", "embers_id": "62d0a3068e478113608732fca6965dbcabca977a"}], "CRSMBCT": [{"content": "EU\u2019s Barnier to Propose European Bank Resolution Body Next Year\nBy Boris Groendahl - 2012-10-22T10:37:13Z\nMichel Barnier will present a plan next year to create an authority to shore up or wind down failing banks as a second stage of the European Union\u2019s bank- rule overhaul.\nEstablishing a European body for ailing banks will follow completion of the EU\u2019s first priority, which is creating a single bank supervisor, Barnier, the bloc\u2019s financial regulation chief, said at a press conference in Vienna. The common supervisor will be set up this year and implemented through 2014, as decided by European leaders last week, he said at the briefing in the Austrian capital.\n\u201cThe second stage is that I will, in the course of 2013, present the European Commission a proposal for a European bank resolution authority,\u201d Barnier said. \u201cIf we have a single supervisor, there\u2019s a need for a single resolution authority, which has a certain amount of legal power.\u201d\nHe said the plan was \u201cthat banks pay for banks, not the taxpayer.\u201d\nBarnier, as well as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, have called for the supervisor to be the first step in building a so-called banking union. EU leaders in June embarked on plans to build a common supervisor as a step toward offering direct bank bailouts from the firewall fund for the countries that share the euro.\nBarnier offered, as part of a draft law on failing lenders that he proposed in June, a plan to provide for national backstops that could to borrow from each other as a last resort, and require them to join forces to stabilize a struggling cross- border bank.\nHe described the measure as an interim step, yet even this incremental move has proved highly controversial. While Italy and France supported the proposals, Germany and Sweden , two EU nations that already have pre-financed funds to stablize failing banks, have both called for the plan to be scrapped.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Boris Groendahl in Vienna at bgroendahl@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Frank Connelly at fconnelly@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 09:55:45", "post_time": "2012-10-22 06:37:13", "author": "Boris Groendahl", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-22/eu-s-barnier-to-propose-european-bank-resolution-body-next-year.html", "title": "EU\u2019s Barnier to Propose European Bank Resolution Body Next Year", "post_date": "2012-10-22", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "CRSMBCT", "embers_id": "9a311539d0785b36679924089779d8192605b257"}], "IBVC": [], "BVPSBVPS": [], "IGBVL": [{"content": "U.S. Stocks Decline as Investors Watch Corporate Earnings\nBy Rita Nazareth - 2012-10-22T13:44:03Z\nPlay\nS&P 500 Stocks Outperform All Asset Classes in 2012\nU.S. stocks declined, following the biggest drop since June in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index, as investors watched third-quarter corporate results.\nCaterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the biggest maker of construction and mining equipment, retreated 1.6 percent after forecasting sales growth that is the slowest in four years. Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) , the largest U.S. coal producer by volume, increased 10 percent as earnings beat analysts\u2019 projections. Ancestry.com Inc. (ACOM) surged 8.1 percent after Permira Advisers LLP agreed to buy the company in a transaction valued at about $1.6 billion.\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.1 percent to 1,431.84 at 9:41 a.m. New York time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 28.21 points, or 0.2 percent, to 13,315.30. Trading in S&P 500 companies was 17 percent below the 30-day average at this time of day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u201cIt really comes down to earnings at this point,\u201d said Peter Jankovskis , co-chief investment officer for Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois , which manages more than $3 billion. He spoke in a telephone interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen many companies beating earnings estimates. Yet investors are keeping an eye on their ability to grow revenue.\u201d\nEarnings at about 69 percent of S&P 500 companies which reported third-quarter results beat analysts estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales missed forecasts at 59 percent of companies, the data showed.\nThe S&P 500 rallied as much as 15 percent from a June low amid unprecedented monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve to boost economic growth. Since peaking at its highest level since December 2007 on Sept. 14, the index has been stuck in a 37- point range on a closing basis. The S&P 500 (SPX) dropped 1.7 percent on Oct. 19, the most since June 21.\nCaterpillar Slips\nCaterpillar slid 1.6 percent to $82.49. Sales growth will be in a range of up 5 percent to down 5 percent next year, the Peoria, Illinois-based company said today in a statement. That compares with year-over-year growth of 31 percent in 2010, 41 percent in 2011 and an estimated 13 percent this year.\nPeabody gained 10 percent to $28.61. Higher natural gas prices encouraged some electricity generators to resume burning coal from the Powder River Basin, Mitesh Thakkar, an analyst at FBR & Co. in Arlington, Virginia , wrote in an Oct. 18 note.\nAncestry.com surged 8.1 percent to $31.54. Permira will pay $32 a share, the companies said today in a statement. The price is 41 percent higher than Ancestry.com\u2019s closing price on June 5, the last day of trading before press reports that the company had hired a financial advisor for a possible sale.\nBeating Assets\nU.S. stocks are beating every major asset class for the first time in 17 years even as economic growth weakens and profits rise at the slowest rate since 2009.\nThe S&P 500 has rallied 14 percent in 2012, beating Treasuries, corporate bonds, commodities, the dollar and equities in Asia and Europe, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The last time that happened, in 1995, the S&P 500 was posting the biggest annual advance of the last five decades. With a price-earnings ratio close to today\u2019s level, the index gained another 93 percent in the next 2 1/2 years.\nFor all the concern about unemployment and manufacturing growth, the best assets this year remain American companies after unprecedented steps by the Federal Reserve to support growth. Forecasts for a rebound in the U.S. economy and the central bank\u2019s pledge to keep interest rates near zero for years convinced bulls the S&P 500 will extend gains. Bears say political gridlock will drag down prices after monetary stimulus wears off.\n\u201cWe see good earnings growth and improving economic outlook, we see good equity valuations and easy monetary policy, we see skeptical investors and low positioning in equity assets,\u201d said Max King , a multi-asset strategist at Investec Asset Management in London, which oversees $100 billion. \u201cThis is a major green light for equities and the fact that people don\u2019t see it, is great.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Rita Nazareth in New York at rnazareth@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net\nU.S. Stocks Decline as Investors Watch Corporate Earnings\nDaniel Acker/Bloomberg\nCaterpillar Inc., the biggest maker of construction and mining equipment, retreated 1.6 percent after forecasting sales growth that is the slowest in four years.\nCaterpillar Inc., the biggest maker of construction and mining equipment, retreated 1.6 percent after forecasting sales growth that is the slowest in four years.

The Tour is controlled by family-owned Amaury Sport Organisation, or ASO.\nArmstrong has denied doping for more than a decade.

UCI could have appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\nHerman, Armstrong\u2019s lawyer, on Oct. 10 described the USADA\u2019s evidence as \u201ca taxpayer-funded tabloid piece rehashing old, disproved, unreliable allegations based largely on axe- grinders, serial perjurers, coerced testimony, sweetheart deals and threat-induced stories.\u201d\nMcQuaid said the UCI had limited powers to uncover what he called the \u201csophisticated\u201d doping regime on Armstrong\u2019s former team, and had to rely on drugs testing.\n\u2018Police Powers\u2019\n\u201cThe UCI doesn\u2019t have police powers,\u201d McQuaid said, adding it was \u201cabsolutely untrue\u201d the organization had covered up failed tests by Armstrong.\nIn other fallout from the 202-page USADA report, Dutch lender Rabobank Groep said last week it would pull its 15 million euros of annual spending on pro cycling.\nArmstrong\u2019s former teammate Levi Leipheimer was fired by the Omega Pharma - Quick Step team after admitting doping in an affidavit to USADA. Johan Bruyneel exited as manager of the RadioShack team. The Belgian, who oversaw Armstrong\u2019s seven Tour wins, denies wrongdoing.\n\u201cThis is the biggest crisis cycling has ever faced,\u201d McQuaid said. \u201cMy message to cycling, to our riders, to our sponsors and to our fans today is: cycling has a future.\u201d\nOlympic Response\nThe other Tour de France winners to lose their titles for doping were Floyd Landis in 2006 and Alberto Contador in 2010. Twenty of the 21 riders to finish in the top three from 1999 to 2005 -- the years Armstrong won -- have been \u201ctied to likely doping\u201d through admissions, sanctions, public investigations or exceeding the UCI\u2019s hematocrit level, USADA said.\nThe International Olympic Committee said it will wait for more information from the UCI about other possible sanctions against the rider before deciding what to do about the bronze medal Armstrong won at the 2000 summer games in Sydney.\n\u201cIt is good to see that all parties involved in this case are working together to tackle this issue,\u201d IOC spokeswoman Emmanuelle Moreau said today in an e-mailed statement.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Alex Duff in Madrid  at aduff4@bloomberg.net Giles Broom in Geneva at gbroom@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Christopher Elser at  at celser@bloomberg.net\nInternational Cycling Union head Pat McQuaid\nFabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images\nInternational Cycling Union head Pat McQuaid said today at a press conference in Switzerland, \u201cLance Armstrong has no place in cycling.\u201d\nInternational Cycling Union head Pat McQuaid said today at a press conference in Switzerland, \u201cLance Armstrong has no place in cycling.\u201d Photographer: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 10:02:32", "post_time": "2012-10-22 09:05:28", "author": "Alex Duff , Giles Broom", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-22/armstrong-stripped-of-tour-de-france-titles-by-governing-body.html", "title": "Armstrong Stripped of Tour de France Titles by Cycling\u2019s UCI", "post_date": "2012-10-22", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "1fe23fda1378b64c8639458fbf669ea199ac5663"}, {"content": "Big Brewers Chase U.S. Cider Growth on Craft Beer Explosion\nBy Clementine Fletcher - 2012-10-21T23:01:00Z\nTy Wright/Bloomberg\nRalph Hugus, owner of Hugus Fruit Farm, loads crates of apples onto a trailer to be brought back for processing at the farm's facility in Rushville, Ohio, on Sept. 11, 2012.\nWith ciders returning to U.S. shelves, big brewers need to keep newfound consumers keen on the fizzy, alcoholic apple drink to counter a slowdown in the U.K.\nHeineken NV (HEIA) , Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) and Carlsberg A/S (CARLA) are all investing in cider as drinkers seeking an alternative to beer boosted U.S. volumes 20 percent last year, contrasting with a 2 percent decline in beer, according to Euromonitor International. Cider acquisitions are still small compared with the prices paid by brewers for beermakers, including a $20.1 billion bid by AB InBev for control of Corona\u2019s maker, while tapping into a market ripe for expansion.\nCraft beers have paved the way for more expensive, niche brands in the U.S., the world\u2019s second-biggest beer market, even as growth of established names like Bud Light and Coors stalls. Moreover, the sweeter taste of cider, with a similar alcohol level to beer, may appeal to women and drinkers seeking novelty.\n\u201cCider\u2019s a growth story because of the demographics --it\u2019s sweet, it\u2019s natural, it appeals to the Coke generation,\u201d Stephen Glancey, chief executive officer of Dublin-based C&C Group Plc, which sells two of the world\u2019s biggest brands in Magners and Gaymers, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s unisex beer.\u201d\nCraft beer\u2019s success is good for the total beer category, Carlsberg\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Joergen Buhl Rasmussen said in an Oct. 12 interview with Bloomberg. The company is creating more products for women, he said, suggesting sweeter brews and ciders may help win sales.\nU.S. Boom\nC&C paid about 20 million euros ($26 million) for U.S. brand Hornsby\u2019s last year and MillerCoors LLC, the U.S. joint venture between SABMiller Plc and Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP) , bought Crispin Cider Co. in February for an undisclosed sum. The Irish company is set to report first-half results tomorrow, and analysts at Davy in Dublin estimate volume growth of as much as 30 percent in the U.S., excluding Hornsby\u2019s.\n\u201cThe potential for growth in cider outside traditional markets is significant,\u201d Barry Gallagher, a Davy analyst, wrote in the note dated Oct. 19.\nThe interest comes as the U.K., the world\u2019s biggest cider market, sees appetite for the drink expand even as the beer market declines, weighed down by tough economic conditions as well as a consumer shift to wine and spirits. Volumes are starting to slow though, according to Euromonitor, and analysts at Societe Generale SA expect stagnant medium-term growth. The U.K. represents about half of the cider category, they estimate.\nCider on Ice\nCider grew at a 10 percent compound annual growth rate between 2005 and 2009 in the U.K., SocGen said. C&C (GCC) \u2019s introduction of Magners in 2006 revitalized the category by creating the trend of serving cider over ice, said Spiros Malandrakis of Euromonitor. The addition of new flavors -- such as pear cider -- have also helped keep drinkers interested.\n\u201cIf there was no innovation, there\u2019d be no cider,\u201d Malandrakis said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t constantly innovate, the category is dead.\u201d The seasonal nature of cider, which traditionally sells more in summer than winter, may drive a push into different flavors or food pairing.\nThe trend toward premium and niche variants has helped reshape cider\u2019s reputation in the U.K. away from connotations of being an inexpensive, relatively strong alcoholic drink toward a more sophisticated tipple.\nPremium Push\n\u201cCider is leaving behind the cheap tramp juice association,\u201d Malandrakis said. \u201cIt\u2019s been consistently and straightforwardly moving in the premium direction.\u201d\nCider sales are estimated to rise at 10.6 percent CAGR by volume in 2011 through 2016, according to Euromonitor, while U.K. rates slow to 5.2 percent. Cider\u2019s countryside image of being niche, local and authentic may help the drink grow on both sides of the Atlantic, and at higher prices, C&C said. Still, cider represents only 0.2 percent of the U.S. beer market, Davy analysts estimate.\nAs C&C and SABMiller (SAB) buy into the U.S., other heavyweight brewing players are unveiling brands to the market. Anheuser- Busch, the world\u2019s biggest brewer, followed the introduction of premium-priced Stella Artois Cidre in the U.K. last year with low-calorie Michelob Ultra Light Cider in the U.S. in May. Boston Beer Co. (SAM) also rolled out its Angry Orchard apple drink across the U.S. at the end of the first quarter.\nStrongbow Sales\nHeineken said Aug. 15 that it\u2019ll take over distribution of Strongbow, the second-biggest brand in the U.S., from the Vermont Hard Cider Co., owner of market leader Woodchuck.\n\u201cCider\u2019s an early trend\u201d in the U.S., where categories aren\u2019t built \u201covernight,\u201d Heineken Chief Executive Officer Jean-Francois van Boxmeer said in August.\n\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on Strongbow as a global cider brand and are going to push it in the U.S. further,\u201d he said. The Dutch brewer bought Belgium \u2019s Stassen SA in June to gain research and development facilities.\nConsumers prefer small, local brands to big names that \u201ctry to be all things to all markets,\u201d counters C&C\u2019s Glancey.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve had outside players and big guys coming into the category,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some very good and some very bad ciders made in the next few years.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Clementine Fletcher in London at cfletcher5@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Celeste Perri at cperri@bloomberg.net\nBig Brewers Chase U.S. Cider Growth on Craft Beer Explosion\nTy Wright/Bloomberg\nCrates of apples wait to be loaded for local delivery at Hugus Fruit Farm in Rushville, Ohio, on Sept. 11, 2012.\nCrates of apples wait to be loaded for local delivery at Hugus Fruit Farm in Rushville, Ohio, on Sept. 11, 2012.

That was less than the 0.77-real per-share median estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\nBradesco, led by Chief Executive Officer Luiz Carlos Trabuco Cappi, 61, set aside 3.3 billion reais to cover loan losses in the third quarter, down from 3.41 billion reais in the previous three months and up from 2.78 billion reais a year earlier. The bank has been slowing credit growth this year as delinquencies for consumer loans in Brazil increase.\n\u201cAlthough operating trends were positive, net income was 5.7 percent below our estimate on lower trading gains and lower- than-expected reduction in loan-loss provisions,\u201d Banco Itau BBA SA analysts including Regina Longo Sanchez wrote in a note to clients today. \u201cLoan growth was weaker than expected, at 1.9 percent quarter over quarter, versus our estimate of 3.8 percent.\u201d\nLate Payments\nBradesco said the delinquency rate for debt overdue more than 90 days was 4.1 percent at the end of September, after reaching 4.2 percent in the second quarter and 3.8 percent in the third quarter of last year.\n\u201cThe worst of the credit-delinquency cycle has passed for Bradesco,\u201d Eduardo Nishio, an analyst at Brasil Plural Corretora de Cambio, Titulos e Valores Mobiliarios SA, wrote in a note to clients on Oct. 1. The Sao Paulo-based brokerage has an overweight rating on Bradesco.\nThe loan book increased 12 percent to 371.7 billion reais in the third quarter from a year earlier, after expanding 14 percent in the previous quarter and 22 percent a year earlier. In June, the bank reduced its forecast for lending growth in 2012 to a range of 14 percent to 18 percent, down from 18 percent to 22 percent. Total assets reached 856.3 billion reais in the third quarter, up almost 19 percent from a year earlier.\nCredit Growth\nBradesco and Itau have been slowing credit growth as delinquencies for consumer loans in Brazil rose to 7.9 percent in May, a 30-month high. The rate remained at the same level in July and August, according to the central bank.\nItau cut its guidance for lending growth in 2012 as it reduces its auto-loan portfolio. The total loan book, including vehicles, will expand about 10 percent this year, Rogerio Calderon, the head of investor relations, said in July. In February, the bank said it expected credit to grow 14 percent to 17 percent.\nFederally controlled Banco do Brasil SA , based in Brasilia, expanded credit 20 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier as it cut borrowing costs under pressure from Brazil President Dilma Rousseff.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Francisco Marcelino in Sao Paulo at mdeoliveira@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Scheer at dscheer@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 10:02:46", "post_time": "2012-10-22 08:11:33", "author": "Francisco Marcelino", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-22/bradesco-third-quarter-net-misses-estimates-on-higher-provisions.html", "title": "Bradesco Profit Misses Analysts\u2019 Estimates on Provisions", "post_date": "2012-10-22", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "399a319f54bda32eecda93cd299b833def8d4c4b"}, {"content": "Corporate Bond Risk Little Changed in Europe as Rally Stalls\nBy Abigail Moses - 2012-10-22T11:44:54Z\nThe cost of insuring against default on European corporate debt was little changed after the biggest weekly rally in more than a month.\nThe Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings fell one basis point to 493 at 12:20 p.m. in London , after falling 48 basis points last week. UniCredit SpA (UCG) , Italy\u2019s biggest bank, is selling subordinated bonds.\nThe rally, which is into its fifth straight month in the longest streak since April (APR) 2011, has stalled before earnings reports from companies including tiremaker Michelin & Cie today and Banco Santander SA (SAN) on Oct. 25. Sales of corporate bonds slowed to 8 billion euros ($10.5 billion) last week from 16 billion euros the week before.\n\u201cThe coming week will be punctuated by the results season, with more than 30 European firms presenting their quarterly results,\u201d Guillaume Thomas, a quantitative analyst at Credit Agricole SA (ACA) in Paris, wrote in a note to investors. \u201cAt the end of the week we should have a good indication of the state of the economy\u2019s health and thus the trend for the end of the year.\u201d\nCorporate bond yields relative to government debt held at 124 basis points, the lowest since July 2011, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s EMU Corporates Non-Financial Index. The spread has shrunk from 201 at the start of the year amid increasing investor confidence that Europe \u2019s leaders can contain the region\u2019s debt crisis.\nUniCredit LT2\nUniCredit is selling 10-year lower tier 2 benchmark bonds in euros. The notes will be priced to yield about 530 basis points more than the swap rate, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they\u2019re not authorized to speak about it.\nThe Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings rose one basis point to 122. An increase signals improvement in perceptions of credit quality .\nThe Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks and insurers rose one basis point to 163 and the subordinated index increased 2.5 to 290.\nA basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10 million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Abigail Moses in London at Amoses5@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Paul Armstrong at Parmstrong10@bloomberg.net\n", "update_time": "2012-10-22 10:06:51", "post_time": "2012-10-22 07:44:54", "author": "Abigail Moses", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-22/corporate-bond-risk-little-changed-in-europe-as-rally-stalls.html", "title": "Corporate Bond Risk Little Changed in Europe as Rally Stalls", "post_date": "2012-10-22", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stock_index": "IBOV", "embers_id": "461f73333c959e15ddbd648c7c59c26fd416d94b"}], "MEXBOL": []}
