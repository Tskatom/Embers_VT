HSBC was named by 71 percent of 69 U.S. distributors polled. A majority of respondents said that JPMorgan Chase (JPM) & Co. and Barclays were also important issuers in the U.S., Greenwich said in a report today.\nHSBC\u2019s relatively good credit rating and its structured certificate of deposit program were among the reasons Greenwich named the bank the best in the U.S. this year, according to the poll. Barclays topped the list of European issuers because of its access to European investors. Moody\u2019s Investors Service rates HSBC Aa3 with a negative outlook.\n\u201cThe firms that receive the highest ratings for quality from clients are also those that provide comprehensive service throughout the entire structured product lifecycle,\u201d said Andrew Awad, a consultant for Greenwich Associates on structured products, in the report.\nU.S. investors have bought $31.3 billion of structured notes this year, 19 percent less than the same period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies, or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Kevin Dugan in New York at kdugan4@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Alan Goldstein at agoldstein5@bloomberg.net\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "CRSMBCT", "embersId": "49cda5774f79e9cfecc7941dddab5d010c931993"}], "IBVC": [], "BVPSBVPS": [], "IGBVL": [{"postTime": "2012-10-23 08:35:08", "postDate": "2012-10-23", "author": "Rita Nazareth", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-23/u-s-stock-futures-decline-western-digital-tumbles.html", "title": "U.S. Stock Futures Decline Amid Disappointing Results", "updateTime": "2012-10-23 09:28:00", "content": "U.S. Stock Futures Decline Amid Disappointing Results\nBy Rita Nazareth - 2012-10-23T12:35:08Z\nPlay\nU.S.-Centric Stocks Outperform Exposure to China\nU.S. stock futures fell, indicating the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index will drop for the third time in four days, amid disappointing results at companies from 3M Co. to DuPont (DD) Co. and as commodities erased their gain for the year.\n3M, the maker of products ranging from Scotch tapes to dental braces, and DuPont, the most valuable U.S. chemical maker, slumped at least 2.7 percent.

The commission, the bloc\u2019s regulatory arm in Brussels, wants policy makers to start talks about a long-term overhaul of the ETS after emission prices plunged to a record low in April.\n\u201cThe options for structural measures outlined in the report should be discussed and explored without delay,\u201d according to the document.\nEU carbon permits for December dropped 0.1 percent to 7.90 euros a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange as of 10:52 a.m. in London . The contract extended its decline to 28 percent in the past year as the financial crisis hurt industrial production and cut demand from industry for pollution rights, boosting a glut of allowances to almost half of the average annual pollution limit in the system.\nLimit Supply\nThe long-term measures to improve the ETS will complement a short-term plan by the commission to limit the supply of carbon allowances at auctions in 2013-2015 to help prices recover, the report said. The strategy, known as backloading, includes a draft measure to delay sales of an as-yet unspecified number of permits and a one-sentence amendment to the EU emissions trading law to reassert the commission\u2019s right to decide about the timing of auctions.\nThe commission will officially submit next month the backloading proposal with a specific number of permits to be delayed and will invite representatives of national governments in the EU Climate Change Committee to vote on the measure before the end of this year, according to the draft report on the carbon market.\nTo \u201celiminate any uncertainty\u201d about postponing some permits at auctions, the European Parliament and national governments should \u201curgently adopt the proposed mini-amendment to the EU ETS directive that would clarify expressly the relevant provision,\u201d the commission said in the draft report.\nStructural Surplus\nWhile backloading would allow for a \u201cmore stable\u201d functioning of the carbon market in its next trading period starting in 2013 and known as Phase 3, it will not address the structural surplus of allowances, according to the report. To do so the EU will need to enact measures that would affect \u201cmore profoundly and permanently the balance between supply and demand,\u201d the commission said. The scenarios to be floated by the commission would not constitute legislative proposals.\nOne of the options could be increasing the EU target to reduce emissions to 30 percent in 2020 compared with 1990 levels from the current 20 percent, according to the report. To tighten the goal to that level the EU would need to remove 1.4 billion allowances from the market, the draft showed. A revision of the current EU law would require support by national governments and the Parliament.\nNew Decision\nAnother option would be cancelling permits through a new decision by the parliament and member states, without changing the existing law, the commission said in the draft. That would affect allowances to be auctioned while leaving free allocation to companies in the ETS intact, the report showed.\n\u201cThe measure could be effective in addressing the overall supply-demand imbalance over Phase 3 but it would not address the framework after 2020,\u201d according to the commission. Removing permits would ensure that the ETS drives innovation and contributes to renewables and energy efficiency objectives, the draft said.\nThe third potential option included in the draft report is a revision of the 1.74 percent linear reduction factor by which pollution caps in the ETS fall annually from 2013. While the EU law envisages a review of the factor as of 2020, with a decision to be adopted by 2025, the change could be brought forward, according to the commission. Any potential change, which would not only address the imbalance in the next trading period but also affect the supply of allowances after 2020, would need approval by governments and the Parliament.\nTougher Rules\nThe ETS could also be strengthened by expanding into new sectors or tougher rules on imports of carbon offsets in Phase 4 to initially allow \u201cfor no or much more limited access to international credits,\u201d the draft report showed.\n\u201cShort-term demand shocks could be contained through the remaining surplus in the EU ETS, and do not require per definition a large amount of international credits,\u201d according to the commission. \u201cAdditional flexibility could be foreseen, for instance by creating an automatic system that allows an increase in access to international credits under certain circumstances, such as a strong and sustained price increase.\u201d\nThe sixth scenario floated by the commission in the draft document includes two mechanisms to temporarily support the price of allowances: a carbon price floor and a price management reserve. Under the latter an amount of permits could be put in a reserve if a decline in demand would lead to \u201can excessive price decrease,\u201d the commission said.\nThese mechanisms would \u201calter the nature of the EU ETS as a quantity-based mechanism,\u201d according to the draft. \u201cThey carry a downside in that the carbon price may become primarily a product of administrative and political decisions (or expectations about them), rather than a result of the interplay of market supply and demand.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Ewa Krukowska in Brussels at ekrukowska@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Lars Paulsson at lpaulsson@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IGBVL", "embersId": "8c9d0f772325573ac93548503bb6b71cba2004a7"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-23 09:07:17", "postDate": "2012-10-23", "author": "Doug Alex,er, Dakin Campbell , Sean B.

Pasternak - 2012-10-23T13:07:17Z\nRoyal Bank of Canada , the nation\u2019s largest lender, agreed to buy Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) \u2019s Canadian auto-finance and deposit business in a deal providing $4.1 billion in proceeds to Ally.\nRoyal Bank will buy the Ally business for a C$1.4 billion ($1.4 billion) investment net of excess capital with a total price of between C$3.1 billion to C$3.8 billion, the Toronto- based lender said today in a statement. The deal is the largest takeover ever for Royal Bank, eclipsing a $2.16 billion purchase of Centura Banks in 2001.\n\u201cAuto loans came through the crisis as a very, very good asset,\u201d Peter Routledge , an analyst with National Bank Financial, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt was profitable, credit quality was better than people expected, yields were decent so it\u2019s good risk-return. It just seems to me like a good asset for Royal Bank.\u201d\nChief Executive Officer Gordon Nixon , 55, has said Royal Bank would explore \u201cstrategic acquisitions\u201d amid a slowdown in Canadian consumer lending. The company posted a record C$1.13 billion profit at its domestic-banking unit in the third quarter, fueled by increasing deposits, mortgages and loans.\nAlly is getting $620 million above liquidation value, the Detroit-based company said in a statement. Ally put its non-U.S. operations up for sale in May to help repay a $17.2 billion government bailout that left the U.S. with a 74 percent stake.\nRoyal Bank expects the Ally Canada business to generate $120 million in net income on a standalone basis in the first 12 months after closing, the lender said. The takeover is expected to \u201cmodestly\u201d add to per-share earnings in its first year, the bank said.\nAuto Receivables\nRBC will have C$24 billion in auto financing receivables after this transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2013, the bank said.\nRoyal Bank also said it agreed with General Motors Co. (GM) \u2019s Canadian unit to become a provider for low-rate consumer auto loans subsidized by the manufacturer.\nRoyal Bank and competitor Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) had shown interest in Ally\u2019s Canadian operations, a person with knowledge of the matter said last month.\nBank of Nova Scotia offered in August to buy the Canadian banking operations of ING Groep NV (INGA) for C$3.1 billion.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Doug Alexander in Toronto at dalexander3@bloomberg.net ; Dakin Campbell in San Francisco at dcampbell27@bloomberg.net ; Sean B.

(883) \u2019s $15.1 billion bid for Nexen Inc. (NXY) , said a person with knowledge of the matter.\nThis list of deals by Canadian companies in China underscores that reciprocity will be part of foreign investment policies Prime Minister Stephen Harper \u2019s government will release soon, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions aren\u2019t public. Another person with knowledge of the matter said Canada is seeking concessions from China before agreeing to the Nexen deal.\nHarper urged Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to permit proposed investments by Toronto-based Manulife Financial (MFC) Corp. and Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) on a visit to Beijing in February. Canada rejected a C$5.2 billion ($5.23 billion) bid by Petroliam Nasional Bhd., Malaysia\u2019s state-owned oil company, for Progress Energy (PRQ) Resources Corp. on Oct. 19. The rejection sent shares of Canadian oil and gas companies tumbling yesterday, including Calgary-based Nexen.\nHarper said yesterday his government will soon release a \u201cclear and new policy framework\u201d governing foreign investment in Canada, which holds the world\u2019s third-largest oil reserves.\n\u201cOur view is that foreign investment generally speaking is of benefit to the Canadian economy,\u201d the prime minister told reporters in Ottawa. \u201cAt the same time, we are committed to the Investment Canada Act, which requires us to evaluate whether individual transactions are in the net benefit of Canada, and this government has in certain cases decided that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\nScotiabank China\nCanadian companies with pending investments in China include Bank of Nova Scotia , the country\u2019s third-biggest bank, and Manulife Financial, the biggest insurer. Laurie Lupton, a spokeswoman for Manulife, didn\u2019t have an immediate comment.\nWhile Canada\u2019s financial system has been rated the world\u2019s soundest by the World Economic Forum for five straight years, its banks and insurers have had difficulty with Chinese ownership limits and slow regulatory approvals for foreign financial institutions, according to a report by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in January.\nA decision on the Cnooc bid for Nexen will be made based on the six criteria for \u201cnet benefit\u201d laid out in the Investment Canada Act and the government\u2019s guidelines on investments by state-owned enterprises, said Margaux Stastny, a spokeswoman for Industry Minister Christian Paradis, the lawmaker responsible for reviewing foreign investments.\nHarper Pledge\nTakeovers of Canadian energy firms by state-owned enterprises are testing Harper\u2019s pledge to sell more of his nation\u2019s oil and gas to fast-growing Asian countries such as China, whose economy is more than four times larger than Canada\u2019s. Canada needs foreign investment to finance the C$220 billion required to develop its oil sands projects. China\u2019s economy is forecast to grow 7.7 percent this year, compared with 2 percent in Canada, based on a Bloomberg survey of economists.\n\u201cWe do need greater clarity and certainly some consistency if we\u2019re going to go running around the world telling everybody we\u2019re open for business,\u201d said John Stephenson , who helps manage C$2.7 billion at First Asset Management Inc. in Toronto. \u201cWe do need to develop these resources and that needs a lot of capital we just don\u2019t have domestically.\u201d\nLinking transactions in Canada to approvals by other governments may complicate deals such as Cnooc\u2019s bid for Nexen, said Gordon Houlden, a former Canadian diplomat in China.\n\u201cIf the procedure is already a bit of a black box, it becomes even more complex,\u201d said Houlden, director of the China Institute at the University of Alberta in Edmonton.\nCall Timeout\nThe regulatory process for the Nexen acquisition is proceeding normally, said Peter Hunt, a Calgary-based spokesman for Cnooc, China\u2019s largest offshore oil producer. Patti Lewis, a spokeswoman for Nexen, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a voicemail and email seeking comment yesterday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok that the government calls a timeout; we need to look at how we treat those sovereign oil companies ,\u201d said Rick George, former chief executive officer of Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , Canada\u2019s largest oil company, in Calgary yesterday. \u201cAt the same time, you don\u2019t want to turn off the tap on foreign investment. What I\u2019m hopeful for is that the government comes out with a clear set of guidelines.\u201d\nProgress Energy pared declines yesterday after executives at Petronas and Progress said they planned to meet Canadian government officials to \u201cbetter understand\u201d Canada\u2019s objections in a bid to win approval for the deal. Petronas has 30 days to appeal the ruling or make additional concessions.\nProgress CEO Michael Culbert said he\u2019s \u201choping\u201d the Canadian government will see a net benefit to the sale of his company to Malaysia\u2019s state oil firm.\nMove Forward\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is really move forward,\u201d Culbert said in a phone interview yesterday from the Calgary airport before departing for Ottawa.\nNexen dropped 4.4 percent to close at C$24.04 in Toronto and fell 5 percent in New York yesterday, about 12 percent below Cnooc\u2019s $27.50 offer price. The stock had earlier plunged 11 percent. Progress Energy fell 9.3 percent to C$19.64 in Toronto, the biggest drop since March 2009, cutting its market value to C$4.63 billion. Progress had dropped as much as 23 percent in early trading.\nBeijing-based Cnooc has already made several commitments to Canada to win support for the Nexen sale. These include listing its shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange (X) , establishing Calgary as its base for North and Central America and maintaining Nexen\u2019s employment levels and capital spending program.\n\u201cAll those things make the Canadian government more likely to approve the CNOOC deal,\u201d said University of Alberta professor Wenran Jiang .\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Andrew Mayeda in Ottawa at amayeda@bloomberg.net ; Theophilos Argitis in Ottawa at targitis@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Scanlan at dscanlan@bloomberg.net ; Chris Wellisz at cwellisz@bloomberg.net\nPrime Minister Stephen Harper and Premier Wen Jiabao\nNelson Ching/Bloomberg\nPrime Minister Stephen Harper urged Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to permit proposed investments by Toronto-based Manulife Financial Corp. and Bank of Nova Scotia on a visit to Beijing in February.\nPrime Minister Stephen Harper urged Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to permit proposed investments by Toronto-based Manulife Financial Corp. and Bank of Nova Scotia on a visit to Beijing in February.

Profit missed the 326 million-euro average estimate of 13 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue and other income declined 6.5 percent to 3.05 billion euros.\n\u201cThe outlook for KPN in Germany looks increasingly bleak,\u201d Robin Bienenstock , an analyst at Bernstein, said in a note to clients. \u201cWith no face-saving deal with the soon-to-be- listed Telefonica Deutschland on the cards, they are likely to face a harder go-it-alone strategy that may end up being more capital intensive for diminishing returns.\u201d\nKPN is struggling with changing consumer behavior as smartphone customers communicate more via messaging technology such as WhatsApp or with calling software such as Skype. The company may also face new entrants to the Dutch mobile market after the government starts a spectrum auction on Oct. 31.\nGerman customers of the E-Plus unit are increasingly looking at opportunities to reduce costs and improve prices for subscription bundles, Chief Executive Officer Eelco Blok said in a conference call for investors today. It\u2019s difficult to predict how long that effect will restrain growth, he said.\nStable Share\nKPN had a \u201crelatively stable\u201d market share of 15.9 percent in Germany , Blok said. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization excluding restructuring costs dropped to 323 million euros in the country, on an underlying basis, from 354 million euros.\nKPN declined as much as 4 percent in Amsterdam trading and was down 3.7 percent at 5.59 euros at 12:58 p.m. The slump extended the loss this year to almost 40 percent and valued the company at 8 billion euros.\n\u201cAgainst an uncertain and challenging macro environment we have seen mixed performance across the group,\u201d Blok said. KPN is on track to reach its 2012 market-share targets in the Netherlands, he said. Dutch consumer mobile revenue declined 8.3 from a year earlier, on an underlying basis, as lower traffic volumes were partly offset by higher recurring subscription fees.\nNo Turnaround\n\u201cKPN said they are taking several initiatives to turn around the company, and we\u2019re not seeing any turnaround for the time being,\u201d said Javier Borrachero, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets who has a reduce recommendation on KPN shares. \u201cThe traditional growth assets Belgium and Germany are starting to feel the pinch of increasing competition.\u201d\nKPN confirmed its 2012 outlook for earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization excluding restructuring costs of 4.7 billion euros to 4.9 billion euros, with free cash flow of 1.6 billion euros to 1.8 billion euros. It also repeated its outlook for a 2012 dividend of 35 cents a share. Ebitda excluding restructuring in the third quarter declined to 1.17 billion euros from 1.33 billion euros a year earlier.\nDeclining earnings caused KPN to breach its target range on its net debt-to-Ebitda ratio in the quarter, which rose to 2.7.\n\u201cWe recognize we are outside our self-imposed financial framework in this quarter, and we expect that this situation could continue for the coming quarters,\u201d Blok said.\nContrary Results\n\u201cThe numbers today indicate another direction than the company has been guiding for,\u201d Kepler\u2019s Borrachero said in an interview.\nTo strengthen its balance sheet , KPN has tried to sell Belgian mobile-phone unit Base after it ended discussions on a potential merger involving the E-Plus wireless unit in Germany. The non-binding offers it received for Base were unsatisfactory, KPN said in August.\nBlok has accelerated job cuts and plans to eliminate as many as 5,000 positions in the Netherlands by the end of 2013, as KPN has a \u201ctough but achievable\u201d goal of cutting costs at headquarters by 30 percent to 40 percent, it said in April.\nKPN said in January that 2012 will be a transition period after two years of declining net income, as it accelerates Dutch investments. The company predicted lower profit and cash flow this year and said it won\u2019t buy back shares in 2012 after last year\u2019s 1-billion euro program.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Maaike Noordhuis in Amsterdam at mnoordhuis@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Benedikt Kammel at bkammel@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IGBVL", "embersId": "9193a417b705d1881cc36df5e3e4ee9fc0d43540"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-22 19:01:00", "postDate": "2012-10-22", "author": "Amy Thomson", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-22/ee-to-sell-4g-in-the-u-k-with-36-pound-plan-kevin-bacon-ads.html", "title": "EE to Sell 4G in the U.K. With 36-Pound Plan, Kevin Bacon Ads", "updateTime": "2012-10-23 09:28:50", "content": "EE to Sell 4G in the U.K. With 36-Pound Plan, Kevin Bacon Ads\nBy Amy Thomson - 2012-10-22T23:01:00Z\nEE, Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) and France Telecom SA (FTE) \u2019s U.K. mobile-phone venture, will begin selling the country\u2019s first fourth-generation wireless service in plans starting at 36 pounds ($57.65) a month with a two-year contract.\nEE is also mounting an advertising campaign that will cost the company tens of millions of pounds and will feature appearances by actor Kevin Bacon, Mat Sears, a spokesman, said in an interview. The first print ads for the new service will appear on Oct. 30, the day the plans go on sale. The TV campaign will debut during \u201cX-Factor\u201d on Nov. 3, he said.\nEE, the U.K.\u2019s largest wireless operator, priced its 4G service at 10 percent to 20 percent higher than plans for third- generation technology and promised performance about five-times faster than the older network. The company, called Everything Everywhere until a rebranding last month, has a six-month head start on rivals who will bid for 4G spectrum in an auction in 2013.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of competition in the market, and with the benefit of a new brand, we want to slip back and say, \u2018How can we make this simpler for customers?\u2019\u201d Pippa Dunn, chief marketing officer for EE\u2019s consumer business, said at a presentation.\nThe new plans will include unlimited calls and texts and will range from 36 pounds to 56 pounds a month for between 500 megabytes to 8 gigabytes of data with a two-year contract.

The benchmark measure has climbed 21 percent this year, the best performance among the largest emerging markets, as international money managers bought a net $18.1 billion of Indian shares, data compiled by the country\u2019s market regulator and Bloomberg show.\nWhile Mumbai-based securities firm Dolat Capital Market Pvt. advises cutting holdings of State Bank of India because of loan losses and Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. has downgraded Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) on slower earnings growth, Templeton Emerging Markets Group\u2019s Mark Mobius is increasing his Indian holdings. Mobius, who oversees $48 billion, cites Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \u2019s efforts to open up the economy for his bullish stance.\n\u201cThey are going through a reform process so there\u2019s a lot of opportunities,\u201d Mobius said in an Oct. 12 interview in Singapore. \u201cWe are adding now.\u201d\nThe Sensex index is valued at 16 times reported earnings, the most expensive of the so-called BRIC markets after Brazil and about 5 percent below its average since 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge trades for 2.7 times book value, or assets minus liabilities, a 15 percent discount to its historical average, the data show.\nGrowth Plan\nSingh began a campaign in September to revive India \u2019s economic growth from the weakest level since 2009 and avoid a credit-rating downgrade. He lowered taxes on companies\u2019 overseas borrowing and announced plans to open the country\u2019s retail and aviation industries to foreign investment.\nThe 80-year-old leader unveiled more policy changes this month, including proposals to boost overseas investment in the insurance and pension industries, which require support from his party\u2019s coalition partners to win parliamentary approval. Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Oct. 12 that he plans further changes in capital markets , banking and infrastructure in the next few weeks.\nPolitical Support\n\u201cIndia has shown us time and again that with a few fairly simple policy moves, you can ratchet up growth very fast,\u201d Arjuna Mahendran , the Singapore-based head of Asia investment strategy at HSBC Private Bank , which manages about $500 billion, said in an Oct. 11 interview on Bloomberg TV India.\nMahendran expects the Sensex to climb above 20,000 in the next six months, he said in a separate interview on Oct. 1. That\u2019s at least 6.9 percent higher than the index\u2019s close of 18,710.02 in Mumbai today.\nSingh may struggle to win the political support needed to enact his recommendations, Daphne Roth , the Singapore-based head of Asian equity research at ABN Amro Private Banking, said in an e-mailed response to questions on Oct. 9. Returns from Indian stocks may be limited by inflation, the government\u2019s budget shortfall and the current-account deficit, she said.\nInflation quickened to 7.81 percent in September, the fastest level among the BRICs and above the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s comfort level of about 5 percent, according to government data released on Oct. 15. The budget shortfall may reach 6 percent of gross domestic product in the year through March 2013, compared with the government\u2019s target of 5.1 percent, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s . The current-account deficit in the three months ended June was 3.9 percent of GDP.\nBRIC Outlook\nThe wave of policy announcements has failed to convince equity analysts the surge in Indian stocks will continue. Their 12-month return forecasts for the Sensex index turned negative this month for the first time in two years and the projection as of yesterday was for a 1.9 percent gain, down from 19 percent five months ago. That compares with estimated increases of at least 18 percent for benchmark indexes in China, Brazil and Russia , data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nIndian analysts have been too bullish every week since Bloomberg began compiling the projections in July 2010, overestimating returns by an average 21 percentage points, the data show.\nAnalysts cut fiscal 2013 profit forecasts for Sensex companies by 1.4 percent since June, when earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization fell to 19.5 percent of sales, the data show. The so-called Ebitda margin, a gauge of profitability, for the quarter ended June matched the lowest level since 2003.\nRefining Margins\nDeepak Pareek, an analyst at Mumbai-based brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher who cut his recommendation on Reliance Industries to reduce from accumulate on Aug. 23, said in an Oct. 11 phone interview that refining margins are unlikely to rise \u201csignificantly\u201d from current levels. Reliance is also struggling to win government approval to develop new gas discoveries, he said.\nPareek maintained his rating in an Oct. 16 note and said he expects Mumbai-based Reliance to trade at 805 rupees in the next 12 months, compared with its closing level of 823 the previous day. On Oct. 17, 2011, he predicted the stock would reach 952. It peaked at 905 in intraday trading on Nov. 4 before slumping to as low as 673.05 on May 16.\nAnalysts covering State Bank , India\u2019s largest lender, reduced their share-price estimates by 2.7 percent this year even as the stock surged 38 percent.\nState Bank\nRakesh Kumar, an analyst at Dolat Capital Market, lowered his recommendation on the lender to reduce from accumulate on Aug. 13 and gave a price target of 1,810 rupees, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s 19 percent below State Bank\u2019s closing price of 2,240.95 rupees in Mumbai trading yesterday.\nKumar predicted on Oct. 19, 2011, the stock would rally about 24 percent to 2,317. The shares fell to as low as 1,571.10 rupees on Dec. 20 after State Bank reported an increase in defaults. Now, Kumar is advising investors to cut holdings as there are few signs of improvement in loan quality , he said in an Oct. 15 phone interview.\nOverseas investors increased their stake in State Bank to 9.1 percent of the shares from 7.9 percent in December, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg. Foreign inflows into Indian stocks this year are the biggest among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the time to be bearish on India,\u201d David Gaud, a senior money manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management in Hong Kong, which oversees about $18 billion in equities and convertible bonds, said in an Oct. 15 phone interview.\nFalling Valuations\nState Bank is valued at a 4 percent discount versus the MSCI Emerging Markets Financials Index, compared with a premium of as much as 26 percent two years ago, according to price-to- book ratios compiled by Bloomberg. Reliance Industries\u2019 price- earnings ratio has fallen to a 18 percent discount to Rio de Janeiro-based Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil\u2019s state-run oil producer, from a 22 percent premium at the start of the year.\nThe Sensex returned an average 29 percent in 12 months during periods from 1980 to 2011 when the combined budget and current-account deficits were more than 8 percent of GDP, according to Deutsche Bank AG. India\u2019s budget shortfall was 5.8 percent of GDP and the current-account gap was 4.2 percent in the 12 months ended March 2012.\n\u201cWhen the twin deficits are high like now, something happens,\u201d Ajay Kapur, Deutsche Bank\u2019s head of Asian equity strategy in Hong Kong , wrote in an Oct. 8 report. \u201cPolicy reforms get enacted while valuations already reflect the grim situation.\u201d\nStill Skeptical\nSingh cut taxes, reduced tariffs and removed restrictions on foreign investment in the auto and pharmaceutical industries during his five years as finance minister from 1991 to 1996.\nIndia\u2019s economy expanded at an average annual pace of about 6 percent in the period, compared with 3.6 percent for emerging markets, according to the International Monetary Fund . The Sensex climbed about 170 percent during Singh\u2019s term.\n\u201cMost Indian analysts are still skeptical about how the government can push forward the reforms,\u201d said Edmond de Rothschild\u2019s Gaud, who\u2019s been adding to infrastructure-related companies. \u201cIndia is probably the market where we\u2019ve been turning more active and more positive over the past three to four months.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Shikhar Balwani in Mumbai at sbalwani@bloomberg.net ; Michael Patterson in London at mpatterson10@bloomberg.net ; Weiyi Lim in Singapore at wlim26@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Darren Boey at dboey@bloomberg.net\nTempleton Emerging Markets Group Chairman Mark Mobius\nTomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg\nTempleton Emerging Markets Group Chairman Mark Mobius.\nTempleton Emerging Markets Group Chairman Mark Mobius.

USADA\u2019s stand was upheld yesterday by the International Cycling Union, known by the French acronym UCI.\nThe UCI decision came after USADA released a 202-page summary of its findings on Oct. 10, which stated that Armstrong \u201cengaged in serial cheating\u201d throughout his career.

It settled the suit in 2006, agreeing to pay the $5 million and $2.5 million in interest and legal fees.\n\u201cThe entire arbitration award and payment by us was premised on the fact that Mr. Armstrong was the official winner of the Tour de France,\u201d Jeffrey Tillotson, outside counsel for SCA, said yesterday in a telephone interview. \u201cHe is no longer that official winner and has no legal right to maintain or keep those bonus funds.\u201d\nTillotson said that SCA also paid Armstrong a $1.5 million bonus in 2002 and $3 million in 2003 for his Tour de France wins. If Armstrong doesn\u2019t repay the bonuses, Tillotson said SCA will pursue all legal avenues to collect.\nAll Funds\n\u201cWe\u2019ll seek return of all of those funds,\u201d Tillotson said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at $9.5 million in bonus.

(NKE) , Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) and Trek Bicycle Corp. after USADA published evidence from 11 former teammates on Oct. 10 that the 41-year-old cheated in winning seven straight Tour de France titles through 2005. Yesterday, sunglass maker Oakley said it was ending its relationship with the rider.\nThe Texan last week also stepped down as chairman of Livestrong, the cancer foundation he founded.\nMarathon Partnership\nLivestrong will continue to be a partner of the NYC Marathon, said Wittenberg, who recalled Armstrong\u2019s support for nine-time race winner Grete Waitz, who died in April (APR) 2011 five years after being diagnosed with cancer.\nArmstrong, who didn\u2019t know Waitz before Wittenberg mentioned that she was fighting the disease, immediately e- mailed the Norwegian to offer his support. Armstrong survived testicular cancer that spread to his lungs and brain.\n\u201cShe said to me in that first year when she was fighting for her life and trying to stay on the treadmill and active and physically fit, Lance\u2019s success against cancer buoyed her and really helped her believe she could beat it,\u201d Wittenberg said of Waitz. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that he helped her have the confidence and the will to fight the cancer and survive for the five years that she did.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Mason Levinson in New York at mlevinson@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Sillup at msillup@bloomberg.net\n1:51\nOct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Mary Wittenberg, president and chief executive officer of the New York Road Runners, talks with Bloomberg's Mason Levinson about the likelihood that Lance Armstrong's results will be stripped from the race organizer's records.

Sao Paulo- based Cosan, the co-owner of the world\u2019s largest sugar-cane processor, trades at a 40 percent discount to Ultrapar, based on estimated 2013 price-to-earnings ratio, according to a Banco Itau BBA SA research report this month.\n\u201cInvestors are underestimating the potential gains from the acquisition of Comgas,\u201d Martins told reporters at the opening of a Cosan terminal yesterday in Itirapina, Brazil . \u201cThe multiples relative to Ultrapar will narrow.\u201d\nCosan, whose 40 percent rally this year is more than 10 times the gain for Brazil\u2019s benchmark Bovespa index, is diversifying into fuel distribution and logistics to create an integrated energy company. Sugar and ethanol, Cosan\u2019s core business until 2008, will account for 22 percent of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and appreciation in 2013, according to Itau BBA estimates.\nCosan trades at about 12 times its estimated 2013 earnings, while Sao Paulo-based Ultrapar, whose shares gained 30 percent this year before today, has a ratio of 20, according to Itau BBA. Cosan has a market value of 15.4 billion reais ($7.6 billion), compared with Ultrapar\u2019s 22.6 billion reais.\nCosan fell 0.5 percent to 37.61 reais in Sao Paulo at 10:28 a.m. as Ultrapar dropped 0.4 percent to 41.41 reais. The Bovespa index fell 0.8 percent.\n\u2018Building a Reputation\u2019\nAn official at Ultrapar, who can\u2019t be identified because of company policy, declined to comment.\nWhile investors normally see Cosan and Ultrapar as peers, the companies are very different in nature and can\u2019t be compared with each other, said Auro Rozenbaum, an analyst at Banco Bradesco SA who covers Brazilian energy companies.\nUltrapar is a holding company with businesses in chemicals production, fuel distribution and liquid storage in port terminals. The company reported second-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 579 million reais, of which 375 million reais came from Ipiranga, its service station division.\n\u201cInvestors pay a premium for Ultrapar because the company has shown resilience even during the worst economic crisis -- it\u2019s a defensive stock,\u201d Rozenbaum said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. \u201cCosan, on the other hand, is building a reputation. They are doing a good job, but it is still a story that is being written.\u201d\nExxon Purchase\nOf the 16 analysts who rate Cosan, 11 say buy. Ultrapar has three buy ratings , five holds and 2 sell recommendations.\nProfit at Cosan, which used to swing with sugar and ethanol prices, has become more stable since it expanded into fuel distribution by buying Exxon Mobil Corp.\u2019s Brazilian unit in 2008, Martins said. In 2010, Cosan agreed to combine some assets including service stations and sugar and ethanol mills with Royal Dutch Shell Plc.\u2019s Brazilian unit to create the country\u2019s third-largest fuel distributor after Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Ultrapar.\nThe fuel-distribution\u2019s unit\u2019s ebitda more than doubled from a year earlier to 367.4 million reais in the fiscal first quarter ended June 30, while the sugar-cane crushing business posted a drop in Ebitda of 21 percent to 323.5 million reais.\n\u201cCosan\u2019s good performance year to date reflects, to some extent, market recognition of the similarities between its story and Ultrapar\u2019s,\u201d Itau BBA analysts led by Paula Kovarsky said in an Oct. 11 report. \u201cThe company has more to capture on a relative basis.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Lucia Kassai in Sao Paulo at lkassai@bloomberg.net ; Adriana Arai in Sao Paulo at aarai1@bloomberg.net ; Marisa Castellani in Sao Paulo at mcastellani7@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net\nCosan Catching Up With Ultrapar After Gas Plan\nJC Franca/Bloomberg\nSugarcane is unloaded at the Cosan SA Industria e Comercio facility in Piracicaba, Brazil.\nSugarcane is unloaded at the Cosan SA Industria e Comercio facility in Piracicaba, Brazil.

The crop was a record 29.5 million tons last year.\nWheat climbed 33 percent this year as dry weather in parts of the European Union and Russia cut global stockpiles to the lowest in four years, helping boost food costs 7.7 percent the past three months. The U.S. Department of Agriculture cut its estimate for Australian output 12 percent to 23 million tons on Oct. 11. That may be lowered by 2 million tons in coming reports because of dry conditions, said Rabobank International.\n\u201cWestern Australia had a very prolonged dry stretch through the cropping year,\u201d said David Johnson , general manager of risk and pricing at Emerald Group Australia Pty in Melbourne. Eastern Australia \u201chasn\u2019t been getting convincing rain to be able to fulfill crop potential, so the crop has just been slowly declining.\u201d\nThe Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, or Abares, will revise its estimate in December.\nPrice Gains\nWheat for delivery in December declined 0.9 percent to $8.70 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 4:41 p.m. in Singapore . Futures rose 0.7 percent yesterday, advancing for the fourth straight session. The grain is the best performer this year on the Standard & Poor\u2019s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities.\nCBH Group, Western Australia\u2019s top grain handler, said Oct. 3 it expects to receive from the region between 9.1 million tons and 9.3 million tons this harvest , down from a record 15 million tons last year, after a dry July and August. That compares with its prediction of 9 million tons to 10 million tons on Sept. 5.\nWestern Australia\u2019s southwest had the driest July on record while the state had below-average rainfall in August and near- average rain in September, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Wheat output in the nation\u2019s biggest producer may drop 39 percent to 7.1 million tons, according to Abares.\n\u201cThe crop has been really under pressure the whole way through,\u201d Emerald\u2019s Johnson said by phone Oct. 19. The east coast is set for an average year, he said.\nGlobal stockpiles will be 173 million tons on May 31, down from a previous estimate of 176.71 million, the USDA said Oct. 11. World output was forecast at 653.05 million tons, down 0.9 percent from the prediction a month earlier, it said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Phoebe Sedgman in Melbourne at psedgman2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Poole at jpoole4@bloomberg.net\nWheat Harvest in Australia Seen Slumping to Lowest in Five Years\nCarla Gottgens/Bloomberg\nA Deere & Co.

(WMT) open stores.\nThe company will spend 1.5 billion rupees ($28 million) in the year to March 31 to add more trucks and build warehouses, Joint Managing Director Vineet Agarwal said in an interview. The spending may help Transport Corp.\u2019s supply chain division, which offers warehousing and packaging, to expand more than 20 percent annually through 2017, he said.\nThe operator plans to add 1,000 more trucks in five years, Agarwal said, as India\u2019s decision to allow foreign investment in retail stores will help create more supermarkets and boost transportation of farm and factory products. Deutsche Post AG (DPW) \u2019s DHL Supply Chain last week said it would invest 100 million euros ($131 million) to strengthen operations in the country.\n\u201cOnce overseas investments start coming into retail sector, it\u2019ll help Transport Corp.,\u201d said Rajni Ghildiyal, an analyst with Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates Ltd. \u201cThe strategy to place itself as a supply chain solutions provider will help it exploit the potential.\u201d\nTransport Corp. rose 0.9 percent to 64.85 rupees in Mumbai today. The stock declined 13 percent in the past year, making it the worst performer on the 29-company Bloomberg Industries Express & Courier Services index after Hanjin Transportation Co.\nSales at Transport Corp.\u2019s supply chain division rose 21 percent to 5.8 billion rupees in the year ended March 31, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The business contributed about 30 percent of total sales, up from 14 percent four years ago.\n\u2018Cold Reefers\u2019\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be investments in farmgate infrastructure once foreign supermarkets set up shop,\u201d Agarwal said in New Delhi. \u201cAt that point, certain amount of logistics, including cold reefers and dry goods movement, will be required. We\u2019re prepared to handle that.\u201d\nLast month, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh\u2019s government allowed overseas retailers such as Wal-Mart and Carrefour SA (CA) to own as much as 51 percent in supermarket ventures. Singh also cut energy subsidies, allowed foreign airlines to own as much as 49 percent in local carriers and permitted overseas investment of up to 49 percent in power exchanges, ending two years of policy gridlock.\nSingh\u2019s policy drive prompted ally Trinamool Congress to quit the alliance. Last year Singh put the plan to ease investment rules for overseas retailers on hold after opposition parties as well as Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee protested.\nWal-Mart may take about 12-18 months to open retail stores in India, Scott Price, its head of Asia operations, said Sept. 21. The world\u2019s biggest retailer has been building a supply chain and logistics network in the country after forming a venture with billionaire Sunil Mittal\u2019s Bharti Enterprises to operate wholesale outlets.\nComputer Systems\nEntry of foreign supermarket chains will spur investments in warehousing, inventory management and computer systems, according to Zenith International Research & Academic Foundation in India . This will help reduce cost for retailers and boost consumer spending, according to Zenith.\nThe size of logistics industry in the country is about $90 billion to $125 billion, according to a study by Deloitte in India and the Indian Chamber of Commerce. Investments in logistics infrastructure may drive economic growth this decade, according to the study. Logistics accounts for 13 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product.\nDHL Supply Chain said Oct. 16 that it will add 5 million square feet of warehousing space in eight cities including Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai. The company also plans to upgrade its fleet of vehicles, it said in a statement.\nCongested Highways\nTransport Corp.\u2019s profit may rise as much as 15 percent this fiscal year, Agarwal said. That\u2019ll be the slowest pace of growth in four years, according to Bloomberg data.\nThe company\u2019s operating margin increased to 6.1 percent in the year ended March 31 from 5.8 percent a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in the period expanded at 5.5 percent, slower than the 22 percent expansion in the year earlier period, the data shows.\nTransporters have to contend with congested highways in India, where infrastructure is ranked worse than Guatemala \u2019s by the World Economic Forum. Traffic snarls cost Asia\u2019s third- biggest economy $5.5 billion annually, according to the Indian Institute of Management in Kolkata and Transport Corp. Trucks take 65 hours to travel the 1,374 kilometers (854 miles) between Mumbai and New Delhi because of traffic and stoppages at toll plazas and state borders.\n\u2018Not Enough\u2019\nRoad construction is lagging behind an August 2009 target of 20 kilometers a day as slowing economic growth and high interest rates discourage builders from bidding for projects.\nPrime Minister Singh\u2019s government has targeted a spending of $1 trillion on roads, ports and railways in the five years through 2017. Authorities are also planning to award $2.3 billion of state-funded highway contracts this year.\n\u201cWhatever we\u2019re doing is not enough,\u201d Agarwal said. \u201cWork on everything from roads, ports to railways is going very slowly.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Karthikeyan Sundaram in New Delhi at kmeenakshisu@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Neil Denslow at ndenslow@bloomberg.net\nWal-Mart Entry Spurs TCI Spending on Logistics\nSanjit Das/Bloomberg\nGoods are loaded onto trucks parked at the Transport Corporation of India Ltd.'s TCI-XPS hub in Ambala, Haryana, India.\nGoods are loaded onto trucks parked at the Transport Corporation of India Ltd.'s TCI-XPS hub in Ambala, Haryana, India.
