Heavyweight titleholder Vitali Klitschko\u2019s UDAR is second, with former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko \u2019s party third, having failed to team up to break the president\u2019s grip on the 450-seat Verkhovna Rada, based in the capital Kiev.\nYanukovych, 62, who\u2019s roused the largely ethnic-Russian regions around his native Donetsk by bolstering the status of the Russian language, trumpets stability, economic expansion and this summer\u2019s Euro 2012 soccer tournament among his party\u2019s achievements. While graft has worsened, European ties have soured and growth may reverse in the second half of the year, opponents have struggled since Tymoshenko was locked up in 2011.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no strong alternative to the Party of Regions in eastern and southern Ukraine, which determine the outcome of the elections,\u201d Vadym Omelchenko, president of the Gorshenin Institute that researches social and political issues, said yesterday by phone from Kiev. \u201cVoters are disoriented by the split opposition and it\u2019s in the interests of the Party of Regions not to allow them to unite.\u201d\nBonds, Stocks\nUkraine\u2019s foreign-currency bonds have returned 24 percent this year, the most after Venezuelan debt, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) \u2019s EMBI Global Index, which gauges the yield difference relative to U.S. Treasuries.\nStill, after expanding 5.2 percent last year and 4.7 percent in 2010, the economy will contract in the second half because of lower prices for steel, Ukraine\u2019s main export earner, Erste Bank AG (EBS) and HSBC Holdings (HSBA) have predicted. The Ukrainian Equities Index (UX) is down 46 percent this year, more than any benchmark in the world, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The hryvnia has lost 1.6 percent against the dollar.\nSince coming to power in 2010, Yanukovych has presided over worsening ties with his two largest neighbors. Ukraine is haggling over the price of natural gas with Russia , which supplies more than half of its fuel needs. A planned Association Agreement with the European Union has been delayed indefinitely because of Tymoshenko\u2019s imprisonment for abuse of office.\nInternational Standards\nHer case, which she says was engineered by the president to keep her out of this week\u2019s ballot, has boosted Yanukovych\u2019s prospects in this week\u2019s ballot. He denies involvement.\n\u201cWe regret that the convictions of opposition leaders during trials that did not meet international standards are preventing them from standing in parliamentary elections,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton wrote Oct. 24 in the New York Times. (NYT)\nThe Party of Regions was backed by 23.3 percent of voters, compared with 16 percent for Klitschko\u2019s UDAR, 15.1 percent for Tymoshenko\u2019s Batkivshchyna, and 10.1 percent for the communists, a survey by the Kiev-based Democratic Initiative Fund showed.\nTwenty-four percent of voters are undecided, according to the Sept. 18-Oct. 4 poll, whose margin of error was 2.2 percent.\nTymoshenko\u2019s Batkivshchyna party joined forces with Arseniy Yatsenyuk\u2019s Front Zmin in April. While the nationalist party Svoboda signed a coalition pact with them Oct. 19, Klitschko, whose party\u2019s name means punch, hasn\u2019t followed suit.\n\u2018Roof Down\u2019\n\u201cTo sign any agreements before the elections is like building a house from the roof down,\u201d Klitschko said Oct. 21 in the western region of Zakarpattya. \u201cA coalition should be formed after entering parliament.\u201d\nOpposition politicians have sought to capitalize on worsening graft as Ukraine\u2019s ranking in Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index dropped to 152 from 134 under Yanukovych.\nMaking inroads into his core support, which in July cheered a Party of Regions-backed bill to make Russian a second official language in the eastern half and southern regions, may be tricky in the run-up to presidential elections in three years\u2019 time, according to Kostyantyn Dykan, an analyst at the Razumkov Center for Economic and Political studies.\n\u201cIt all points to Yanukovych being the main candidate for 2015,\u201d he said yesterday by phone from Kiev. \u201cThe situation allows him to look to the future with optimism.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Daryna Krasnolutska in Kiev at dkrasnolutsk@bloomberg.net ; Kateryna Choursina in Kiev at kchoursina@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Balazs Penz at bpenz@bloomberg.net\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "CRSMBCT", "embersId": "9b26ac57da968c626e4f6f0d8bc9e1bab805974e"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-25 12:35:47", "postDate": "2012-10-25", "author": "Agnes Lovasz", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-24/ukraine-investors-bet-on-imf-deal-as-yanukovych-braces-for-vote.html", "title": "Ukraine Investors Bet on IMF Deal as Yanukovych Faces Vote", "updateTime": "2012-10-25 20:40:17", "content": "Ukraine Investors Bet on IMF Deal as Yanukovych Faces Vote\nBy Agnes Lovasz - 2012-10-25T16:35:47Z\nInvestors are betting that Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych will unfreeze an International Monetary Fund loan and devalue the hryvnia after parliamentary elections on Oct. 28.\nThe country\u2019s foreign-currency bonds have returned investors 24 percent this year, the most after Venezuelan debt, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s EMBI Global Index, which gauges the yield difference relative to U.S. Treasuries.\nTo meet longer-term financing needs after the current- account deficit almost doubled to $8.6 billion through August, Ukraine wants to extend a frozen $15.4 billion IMF loan, which expires this year, Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Khoroshkovskiy said Oct. 18. A July sale of $2 billion in dollar debt eased refinancing concern, helping the country outperform its peers, said Ronald Schneider of Raiffeisen Kapitalanlage GmbH.\n\u201cThe hope is that after the election we will see more cooperation with the IMF,\u201d Vienna-based Schneider, who helps manage 700 million euros ($899 million) in emerging-market debt, said in an Oct. 22 phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s also partially priced in that there will be more positive steps in the direction of devaluation. This is reflected in the bond market .\u201d\nIMF Halt\nThe IMF program was halted last March after the government, facing this week\u2019s parliamentary election, refused to raise household utility tariffs sought by the Washington-based lender. Investors are looking beyond the election and seek progress on the IMF talks and a possible hryvnia devaluation to help rebalance the economy, Schneider said.\nThe hryvnia, which has lost 1.5 percent against the dollar this year, was 0.1 percent higher at 8.1738 at 7 p.m. in Kiev, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The cost of insuring Ukraine\u2019s government debt for five years using credit default swaps dropped to 15 basis points to 625. It was 849 basis points at the end of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, reflecting an improved risk perception.\nEmerging-market debt rallied after the European Central Bank announced an unlimited bond-buying program, the Federal Reserve began a third round of quantitative easing and the Bank of Japan (8301) extended its asset purchases.\nYield Drop\nThe yield on Ukraine\u2019s benchmark government bonds due 2013 has declined almost 4 percentage points this year to 6.58 percent. The yield dropped to 6.19 percent on Sept. 20, the lowest in a year. The yield on the dollar bonds due 2017 has dropped 2.87 percentage points since it was sold in July, to 7.03 percent.\nThe downward move in yields may not be sustained because of negative economic trends, Andreas Kolbe, a London-based strategist at Barclays Plc, said in an e-mail today, adding that investors should hold less Ukrainian debt than recommended by benchmark indexes.\n\u201cUkraine credit has enjoyed a significant rally recently, likely driven by the ample global liquidity conditions and the resulting hunt for yield,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe think that economic realities will eventually come back to play a more prominent role. Hence, we reiterate our underweight stance on Ukraine credit.\u201d\nThe Ukrainian Equities Index (UX) is down 48 percent this year, more than any benchmark in the world, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Stocks slid as the economy slumped after growing 5.2 percent last year. Ukraine may have entered a recession last quarter as the global slowdown squeezed the price of steel, the nation\u2019s main export earner, according to Erste Bank (EBS) Group AG and HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)\nPoll Lead\nYanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions is leading in opinion polls. It was backed by 23.3 percent of voters, compared with 15.1 percent for jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko \u2019s Batkivshchyna, a Sept. 18-Oct. 4 survey by the Kiev-based Democratic Initiative Fund showed. World boxing champion Vitali Klitschko\u2019s UDAR party had 16 percent, and the communists, currently in coalition with Yanukovych\u2019s party, had 10.1 percent, according to the poll.\nTo put the economy on track for a recovery by restoring competitiveness and boosting exports, a move which would narrow the current-account deficit , derivatives traders have been betting that the government will be forced to devalue the currency. The hryvnia will drop to 9.33 per dollar in six months and 10.20 in a year\u2019s time, based on non-deliverable forwards.\nQuicker Devaluation\n\u201cThe sooner the devaluation of the hryvnia occurs, the better for the external balance, the economy and the markets,\u201d Alexander Morozov , HSBC\u2019s Moscow-based chief economist for Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan , wrote in an Oct. 22 research note.\nThe hryvnia needs to weaken to 11 per dollar by end-2013 to trim the current-account deficit to 5 percent of gross domestic product, Morozov said. The shortfall will widen to 9 percent of gross domestic product this year, he predicted.\nThe IMF has also pushed for a more flexible hryvnia. Policy makers and the government are seeking to dissuade the public from buying foreign currency in anticipation of a devaluation, central bank Governor Serhiy Arbuzov said Oct. 15.\n\u201cIt could be a positive thing if they devalued the currency because the fundamentals would improve and that could support the spreads a little bit more,\u201d Oliver Kastner, who helps manage about $3 billion in emerging-market bonds at Deka Investment GmbH in Frankfurt said in an Oct. 22 phone interview. \u201cMaybe after the elections a weaker currency will come. It will be necessary.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Agnes Lovasz in London at alovasz@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Balazs Penz at bpenz@bloomberg.net\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "CRSMBCT", "embersId": "09b6e1ba9993273b2e02b0a5e1c2bb16a566e0ae"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-25 09:05:26", "postDate": "2012-10-25", "author": "Eleni Himaras , Bei Hu", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-24/hedge-fund-boxers-tame-animal-instincts-in-hong-kong-fight-night.html", "title": "Hedge Fund Boxers Tame Animal Instincts in H.K.

His second child was born just days earlier.\nBikini-clad models and black-tie wait staff with trays of beer and wine welcomed 600 spectators to the fight, where no sign of looming woes in the financial industry lingered. Carango, 40, executive director at Nomura, who attended West Point and went on to man the turret of an M1 Abrams tank defeated Craig \u201cEl Toro\u201d Barnish in the second round of the evening.\n\u201cShe insulted my manhood, and told me if I didn\u2019t have the \u2019guts\u2019 to sign up, then I should just keep my trap shut about it forever \u201d Carango wrote in his program biography of first mentioning the idea to his wife. \u201cBy the time you read this, she will have just given birth to our second child in two years so I figured that if I didn\u2019t do something painful myself, I would never hear then end of that.\u201d\nThe Eurekahedge Asian Hedge Fund Index returned 2.3 percent in September, the best performer among five regional indexes, based on preliminary figures. Investors have withdrawn more than $440 million this year from funds in the region, where at least 70 hedge funds have closed as equity-focused strategies depressed performance. The index has returned 3.9 percent this year through September compared with the 4.3 percent advance by the global industry gauge.\nThe 14 finalists have been training at Jab Mixed Martial Arts Studio in the heart of the business district twice a week for five months. In addition to the bi-weekly sessions of sparring, punching bag work, crunches and rope-skipping, most have been doing training four to five times a week, and in some cases twice a day. The finalists were culled from 70 hopefuls and will be paired off for seven bouts of three two-minute rounds each.\nOperation Smile\nThe event at the Indian Recreation Club in Happy Valley, organized by IronMonger Events Ltd., seeks to raise HK$1 million ($129,022) for Operation Smile , which funds surgery for children with facial deformities, and Operation Breakthrough , which combats crime and juvenile delinquency in low-income and immigrant communities. Standard tables of 12 cost HK$24,000 with the ringside version pulling in HK$50,000.\nSteve Taw, the oldest competitor at age 53 in the history of Hong Kong \u2019s sixth annual Hedge Fund Fight Nite , competed four years after his son\u2019s victory in the same charity event.\n\u201cI\u2019m the only one ever following in his son\u2019s footsteps,\u201d said the white-haired Taw, known in the ring as \u201cThe Wizard of Wanchai\u201d after the commercial area of bars and clubs made popular in \u201cThe World of Suzie Wong,\u201d the 1960 William Holden movie, before the event.\n\u2018In it to win it\u2019\nHis son Thomas, 27, who sports the same square jawline and broad wry smile, works in electronic trading at Macquarie Group Ltd. He said gets more nervous watching his father, a director at South Ocean Management Ltd., fight than he does stepping into the ring himself. The senior Taw said before the event that while he\u2019s \u201cin it to win it,\u201d his focus will be on putting on a good show when facing off against Blair \u201cThe Bear\u201d Crichton, an associate vice president in business development at HSBC.\n\u201cBoxing is a sport; it\u2019s to be practiced and mastered,\u201d he said before the event. \u201cNot a chance that I want to stand up there swinging wildly for six minutes. That\u2019s for outside the chip shop back home in the U.K. after the pubs turn out.\u201d\nBarnish, 30, co-founder of BAH Partners Ltd. , a recruitment firm specializing in information technology workers at investment banks, said conquering the headstrong nature that proffered his ring name has been the biggest challenge.\n\u201cMy first reaction on getting hit was to lash out and counter,\u201d the sandy-haired native of England \u2019s south coast said before the event. \u201cThe hardest thing has been accepting getting punched, then using your head to react instead of animal instinct.\u201d\nAnimals Sport\nHis mother wishes he wasn\u2019t getting hit at all, calling it a \u201csport for animals,\u201d he said. With co-workers, friends and his girlfriend supportive, he expects his parents to come around after he walks out of the fight without major injury.\nAndrea \u201cGlynn-sanity\u201d Glynn, 28, and Danielle \u201cSteely\u201d Midalia, 30, will face off in the only women\u2019s bout of the evening. They are the final two of 10 women who tried out for the event this spring.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly portrayed as a brute sport, but that is far from the truth,\u201d said Midalia, the creative manager at The Cat Street Gallery, before the event. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a beefy boxer to participate. Boxing requires agility, fortitude and determination, things that all women are capable of.\u201d\nMidalia, a long-distance runner, and Glynn, who has played volleyball, soccer and tennis, both said the mental challenges of boxing far outweigh the physical.\nA-Game\n\u201cAfter a long day at the office, it\u2019s one thing to jump on the treadmill and another thing to step into the ring,\u201d said Glynn, who works in fixed-income sales at Bank of Montreal (BMO) , before the event. \u201cYou really have to show up to every session with your A-game, otherwise you\u2019ll get punched in the face.\u201d\nThe financial industry has been taking its own punches amid shrinking equity volumes. Bank of America Corp., BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG, Macquarie, Morgan Stanley, Nomura Holdings Inc., and UBS AG are all shedding jobs.\nEquity volumes dropped 21 percent globally year-on-year in September and 14 percent year-on-year for the first nine months of 2012, according to the World Federation of Exchanges .\nGiven the downturn, making time for training while managing a more challenging workload has been difficult, said Mark \u201cSlugger\u201d O\u2019Reilly, 36, a managing director at recruitment firm Astbury Marsden . Lessons learned from the discipline required for boxing translate outside the ring, said the former Australian rules football player from Tasmania state.\n\u2018The Razor\u2019\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about executing your plan,\u201d he said before the event. \u201cYou have to keep composure regardless of what\u2019s going on around you.\u201d\nGeorge \u201cThe Razor\u201d Radford, a consultant at property investment company IP Global, faced off against O\u2019Reilly after going along to the event last year, having one too many drinks, and telling everyone that would listen that he\u2019d be in the ring in 2012. Not one to go back on his word, he responded when the organizers followed up, the 29-year-old rugby player said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie to you, it\u2019s been bloody exhausting and I really can\u2019t wait for the whole thing to be over\u201d he said before the event. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to stop thinking about Mark O\u2019Reilly.\u201d\nHSBC, Nomura\nOther fighters in tonight\u2019s event included Nicolas Boulay, a derivatives broker at Louis Capital Markets ; Carango of Nomura; Adam Gazal, a managing partner at National Australia Bank Ltd.; Grant Livingston, an executive director in convertible bonds at JPMorgan Chase & Co.; Brad Moreland, a director in prime services at HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ; Richard Rouse, an account manager at HSBC, and Andrew Wylde, head of sales and operations at Hatstand Consulting.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Eleni Himaras in Hong Kong at ehimaras@bloomberg.net ; Bei Hu in Hong Kong at bhu5@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Hwee Ann Tan at hatan@bloomberg.net\nStephen Taw and Mark O'Reilly\nJerome Favre/Bloomberg\nStephen Taw, left, and Mark O'Reilly spar during a training session at the Jab Mixed Martial Arts Studio in Hong Kong, China.\nStephen Taw, left, and Mark O'Reilly spar during a training session at the Jab Mixed Martial Arts Studio in Hong Kong, China.

(GS) director Rajat Gupta was sentenced to two years in prison for insider trading , marking the downfall of a man who rose to the top of corporate America after being orphaned as an 18-year-old in Kolkata.\nGupta, who ran McKinsey & Co. from 1994 to 2003, was sentenced yesterday by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan for leaking stock tips to Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. Gupta, 63, was convicted in June of securities fraud and conspiracy. He is set to report to prison on Jan. 8. He was also fined $5 million.\nGupta\u2019s lawyer, Gary Naftalis , a partner at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP, wrote in a legal brief to the judge last week, \u201cRajat Gupta has lived an exemplary life of uncommon accomplishment, compassion and generosity.\u201d\nHis defense lawyers had requested probation and proposed that he work with needy children in New York or with the rural poor fighting AIDS, malaria and extreme poverty in Rwanda. Gupta previously served as chairman of the Global Fund, a public- health advocacy group for the developing world.\nProsecutors had sought a prison term of as long as 10 years.\nGupta served on the boards of Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) and AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) , won praise for his charity from Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chairman Bill Gates and former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and, as McKinsey\u2019s youngest managing director, almost tripled firm revenue.\nGupta \u201cwas at the pinnacle of a profession built on protecting client confidences,\u201d prosecutors said in court papers. \u201cYet, time and time again, over the span of nearly two years, Gupta flouted the law and abused his position of trust.\u201d\nThe case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-907, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).\nKerviel Loses Appeal on 4.9 Billion-Euro SocGen Trading Loss\nJerome Kerviel lost his bid to reverse a 2010 guilty verdict holding him solely responsible for Societe Generale SA (GLE) \u2019s 4.9 billion-euro ($6.35 billion) trading loss.\nJudge Mireille Filippini yesterday upheld the verdict finding Kerviel guilty of abusing the bank\u2019s trust, faking documents and entering false data into computers. Kerviel argued the bank knew he was exceeding his mandate and used him as a scapegoat for losses on subprime mortgages.\nThe 2008 trading loss was one of the biggest ever, wiping out almost two years of pretax profit at Societe Generale \u2019s investment-banking unit. Kerviel, 35, was called a \u201cterrorist\u201d by then-Chief Executive Officer Daniel Bouton , a comment he refused to apologize for during Kerviel\u2019s June appeal trial.\n\u201cIt is clear that Societe Generale was a victim of these crimes, of which Jerome Kerviel was the sole conceiver,\u201d Filippini said, upholding a three-year prison sentence and an order for him to repay the bank. \u201cSociete Generale is entitled to recover the full amount of the financial harm from unwinding this position.\u201d\nKerviel said in an interview on RTL radio that he was \u201cdistraught\u201d over the decision and will appeal it to France\u2019s highest court, the Cour de Cassation.\nHis lawyer, David Koubbi, who appeared on the radio program with him, said that he expects the appeal may take as long as a year-and-a-half. By going to the Cour de Cassation, Kerviel will remain free at least until that court rules.\n\u201cHe would be crazy not to,\u201d said Christopher Mesnooh, an American lawyer practicing in Paris. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t lose anything in doing so and it\u2019ll keep him out of jail.\u201d\nIn France, the initial appeal is almost always a retrial, with the judges hearing the case essentially from scratch. The Cour de Cassation considers legal issues involved in the decision. The bid for a hearing at the top appellate court is automatically accepted, unlike in the U.S. or U.K., said Stephane Bonifassi, a French criminal lawyer.\n\u201cAppeals in cassation have very, very little chance in criminal matters,\u201d Bonifassi said.\nJean Veil , a lawyer for the Paris-based bank, said Societe Generale is realistic about the chance of Kerviel repaying 4.9 billion euros.\nKerviel\u2019s story -- a native of Brittany, who rose through the ranks to Societe Generale\u2019s trading floor without having attended any of France\u2019s elite schools -- made him a cult hero in the aftermath of the 2008 loss. There was a comic book, fan clubs and t-shirts supporting his cause. A poll taken after news of the loss broke showed 77 percent of French respondents saw him as a \u201cvictim.\u201d\nKerviel changed defense teams and pursued an aggressive strategy on appeal, filing criminal complaints against the bank in the weeks before the trial began. Societe Generale retaliated with defamation claims and Filippini openly clashed with Koubbi during the hearings, threatening at one point to refer him to the bar association over his treatment of witnesses.\nProsecutors asked Filippini to increase Kerviel\u2019s sentence to the maximum five years, from the three years.\n\u201cGiven how the hearings went, one wasn\u2019t expecting much of an improvement for Mr. Kerviel,\u201d said Bonifassi. \u201cIf there was any suspense, it was whether the punishment would be harsher.\u201d\nFor more, click here.\nNews\nDebt Collectors Face Consumer Bureau Supervision in January\nLarge debt collectors, including law firms, will for the first time face supervision to assure they follow federal consumer-protection laws beginning on Jan. 2, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced yesterday.\n\u201cMillions of consumers are affected by debt collection, and we want to make sure they are treated fairly,\u201d Richard Cordray , the agency\u2019s director, said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cWe want all companies to realize that the better business choice is to follow the law -- not break it.\u201d\nThe regulation will cover any company that has more than $10 million in annual receipts from consumer debt collection. That definition will capture about 175 collectors, representing 60 percent of the industry\u2019s annual revenues, according to the CFPB.\nThe new rule could erode profits at major debt collectors including Norfolk, Virginia-based Portfolio Recovery Associates Inc. (PRAA) , the largest publicly held firm in the business, San Diego- based Encore Capital Group Inc. (ECPG) and Asta Funding Inc. (ASFI) , based in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. It could also affect the largest player by revenue, NCO Group, a unit of New York-based JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) \u2019s private equity arm, One Equity Partners.\nThe accounts-receivable industry had revenues of $17 billion in 2011, according to Kaulkin Ginsberg, a Rockville, Maryland-based consulting firm. In addition to debt collectors, the industry includes debt buyers, who purchase written-off debt from creditors such as credit-card issuers. Debt collectors can be independent agents, employees of buyers or members of law firms.\nThe regulation closely tracks a Feb. 17 CFPB proposal that was opposed by the debt-collection industry because of the $10 million revenue threshold. ACA International, an association of debt collectors, in an April 10 letter called the figure \u201carbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion and not otherwise in accordance with law.\u201d\nThe regulation also includes partial coverage of collection lawyers. Earlier this year, groups including the National Association of Retail Collection Attorneys and the American Bar Association criticized the agency\u2019s initial proposal.\nThey said that Dodd-Frank exempts attorneys from Title X, the section of the law creating the CFPB, on the grounds that they are lawyers, not consumer financial services providers.\n\u201cAs is clear from the legislative history of the act, Congress took pains to exclude attorneys engaged in the practice of law,\u201d the bar association wrote in an April 11 letter.\nThe final rule covers law firms meeting the agency\u2019s definition of debt collectors, namely those \u201cwhose principal business activity is debt collection\u201d or who regularly engage in debt collection, according to the regulation.\nFor more, click here.\nStaples Co-Founder Ex-Wife Won\u2019t Block Romney File Unsealing\nThe ex-wife of Staples Inc. (SPLS) co-founder and Highland Capital Partners Chairman Tom Stemberg said she won\u2019t block a bid to unseal documents in her divorce, in which Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney gave information.\nGloria Allred , a women\u2019s rights lawyer, appeared yesterday in Norfolk Probate court in Canton, Massachusetts, with Maureen Sullivan Stemberg and said she\u2019s backing a Boston Globe request to unseal the documents. Jonathan Albano, an attorney for the Globe, described the information the newspaper sought as \u201cexpert testimony on a financial matter.\u201d\nStemberg, 63, spoke at the Republican national convention, where Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, was given the party\u2019s nomination for the Nov. 6 presidential election. Framingham, Massachusetts-based Staples, an office-supply retailer, grew with the help of an investment from Bain Capital LLC, the private-equity firm Romney co-founded.\n\u201cThe sooner we get out from this, the better,\u201d Robert Jones , an attorney for Romney with Ropes & Gray LLP, told the court.\nStemberg is a co-founder and managing general partner of Highland Consumer Fund, a venture capital fund based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that focuses on retail and consumer service companies. It is affiliated with Highland Capital Partners LP.\n\u201cOver the past several years, the judge in this case has made it very clear that the gag order imposed should not be violated,\u201d George Regan, Stemberg\u2019s spokesman, said in an e- mail. \u201cWe have never violated this order and will continue to adhere to the court\u2019s ruling in this case.\u201d\nStemberg\u2019s attorney, Brian Leary, lost a bid yesterday to have the courtroom closed during arguments over the unsealing.\nThe judge set a hearing for today on whether to unseal the documents. A Staples attorney, Lisa Arrowood, asked for time to review two volumes of Romney\u2019s testimony dating back to the 1980s.\nAllred and her client declined to answer questions after the hearing.\nAllred is a partner in Allred, Maroko & Goldberg. On its website, the Los Angeles-based firm describes its practice areas as employment law, discrimination, sexual harassment and civil rights law.\nFor more, click here.\nFirm News\nWomen Lawyers at Big Firms Struggle for Pay and Power\nDespite the efforts of law firms to promote gender parity, women at the 200 biggest firms in the U.S. still lag men in power and pay, according to the seventh annual survey by the National Association of Women Lawyers.\nWomen account for 15 percent of equity partners, about the same percentage as in the first survey. Their compensation trails behind men\u2019s at all levels, most notably at the equity- partner level, where women earn 89 percent of what men do, the organization said in a statement. Women hold 20 percent of the positions on a firm\u2019s highest governance committee, and women are firm-wide managing partner at 4 percent of firms. They make up 70 percent of the nonpartner track, lower paid, staff attorney positions, according to NAWL. That\u2019s the only category in which they are a majority.\nEfforts to explain the pay differences were foiled by compensation systems that lack transparency and could incorporate unintended bias, according the text distributed with the survey.\n\u201cThe gap between male and female compensation at the equity partner level does not correlate with male/female differences in billable hours, total hours or books of business, begging the question of how firms actually set compensation for their partners,\u201d NAWL Foundation President Stephanie Scharf, a partner at Scharf Banks Marmor LLC in Chicago, said in a statement.\nMoreover, the survey found the pay discrepancies begin at the associate level, where new women lawyer earn 99 percent of what men earn and make less in bonuses. Women constitute nearly 45 percent of the associate pool, yet they receive only 40 percent of the bonuses, the report says.\nIf trends continue, the future looks dim, particularly given that for the second year in a row, the proportion of women entering big-firm practice has decreased, the report said.\nDeals\nToronto-Dominion to Buy $5.9 Billion Target Card Portfolio\nSimpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP\u00a0advised Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , Canada\u2019s second-largest bank, which agreed to buy the $5.9 billion U.S. credit card portfolio of Target Corp. (TGT) Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP\u00a0partner Andrew Faulkner represented Target Corp. Sidley Austin represented Target in connection with the Program Agreement addressing the operation of the program going forward.\nSimpson Thacher partners included Maripat Alpuche, Lee Meyerson, mergers and acquisitions; Stacie McGinn, financial institutions regulatory; Laura Palmer, structured finance; Michael Naughton, antitrust; Steve Todrys, tax; Lori Lesser, intellectual property.\nSidley lawyers included financial institution regulation partners William S. Eckland and David E. Teitelbaum.\nThe portfolio will be sold for an amount equal to the gross value of the outstanding receivables at the time of closing, Minneapolis-based Target said in a statement. TD also agreed to a seven-year deal to underwrite, fund and own the retailer\u2019s future credit card and Visa receivables in the U.S., the companies said.\nToronto-Dominion said the transaction will help it meet a forecast for $1.6 billion in U.S. consumer-banking profit by next year. The Toronto-based lender has more branches in the U.S. than it does in Canada.\nTarget will record pretax gains of about $150 million in the third quarter, and additional pretax gains of $350 million to $450 million when the deal is completed, the company said. The second-largest U.S. discount retailer suspended the sale of the credit-card portfolio in January after it had been unable to find a buyer for a year.\nFor more, click here.\nIn-House\nRio Tinto Unit Lawyer Barred From Leaving Mongolia on Inquiry\nAn Australian lawyer working for a company controlled by Rio Tinto Group (RIO) has been barred from leaving Mongolia to assist with a corruption probe by the government.\nSarah Armstrong, chief legal counsel for Vancouver-based SouthGobi Resources Ltd. (SGQ) , is assisting authorities with a corruption case involving the company she works for, the resources authority of Mongolia and the Mongolian anti- corruption authority, according to Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Bob Carr.\n\u201cShe hasn\u2019t been detained, she hasn\u2019t been arrested, her passport hasn\u2019t been taken from her but the authorities in Ulan Bator are seeking to interview her further,\u201d Carr told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s 774 radio program.\nSouthGobi, controlled by Rio Tinto\u2019s 51 percent-owned unit Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TRQ) , said in a statement yesterday it\u2019s cooperating with Mongolian authorities and that none of its employees have been charged with any crimes. The company said on May 8 that Mongolia\u2019s anti-corruption agency had asked one of its units for information for an investigation into a third party.\nRio Tinto, the world\u2019s third-biggest mining group, in January gained control of Turquoise Hill, whose name was changed from Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. in August. The acquisition handed Rio the stake in SouthGobi as well as control of Oyu Tolgoi, where Rio plans to start production next year.\nWal-Mart Reorganizes Compliance Office Amid Bribery Probe\nWal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world\u2019s largest retailer, hired Jay Jorgensen, an attorney with Sidley Austin LLP in Washington, as global chief compliance officer.\nWal-Mart also combined its compliance office with ethics, investigations and legal functions to form one organization amid a bribery probe at the company\u2019s Mexico operations.\nThe new unit will report to the company\u2019s general counsel, Wal-Mart said in a memo. The moves come after Wal-Mart named Daniel Trujillo to the new position of senior vice president and chief compliance officer of its international operations earlier this month.\nThe U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating allegations that Wal-Mart systematically bribed Mexican officials so it could more quickly open stores, possibly violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nJorgensen previously served as a law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist and for Justice Samuel Alito while he was at the 3rd U.S. Court of Appeals, according to the memo.\nHSBC Says Preeta Bansal Joins Bank as Global Litigation Counsel\nHSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) said Preeta Bansal, who served as a senior policy adviser to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, is joining the bank as global general counsel for litigation and regulatory affairs.\nBansal will be based in London and report to Stuart Levey , the company said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.\nMoves\nMintz Levin Hires Chadbourne Hedge Fund Head in New York\nMintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo PC announced that Adam Gale, the former head of Chadbourne & Parke LLP\u2019s hedge fund practice group, has joined the firm as a member in the corporate and securities section in New York.\nGale has experience in the structuring, formation and fundraising efforts of hedge funds and private equity funds as well as providing regulatory and compliance advice to the funds, their sponsors and broker-dealers, banks, and registered investment companies. Also, he represents numerous institutional investors in their investments into all fund types.\n\u201cAs we continue to see hedge funds and other private funds become an increasingly important element of capital markets and financial services, we\u2019re thrilled to welcome Adam and his wealth of expertise in both the structuring and regulatory compliance of these entities,\u201d Peter Demuth, chairman of the corporate and securities section said in a statement.\nMintz Levin has 500 lawyers in eight offices in the U.S. and London.\nKatten Muchin Hires Financial Services Partner\nKatten Muchin Rosenman LLP announced that David Y.

The euro pared losses after reports on talks between Greece and international-aid officials. Federal Reserve policy makers end a two-day meeting today. Sweden\u2019s krona slid for a fourth day against the dollar after data showed consumer confidence worsened.\n\u201cFor the German Ifo, the current assessment was weaker and expectations did not rise, which might\u2019ve been a bit surprising,\u201d Brian Daingerfield, a currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc\u2019s RBS Securities unit in Stamford , Connecticut , said in a telephone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the main things leading to weakness in the euro today.\u201d\nThe shared currency weakened 0.2 percent to $1.2956 at 12:49 p.m. New York time after falling earlier to $1.2921, the lowest level since Oct. 15. The euro lost 0.3 percent to 103.41 yen and reached 102.99 yen, the weakest since Oct. 17. The yen was little changed at 79.83 per dollar.\nThe euro trimmed its decline after a report that officials of the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund rejected a German proposal to tighten Greek access to an aid account. ECB President Mario Draghi said the so-called troika has made no proposals yet on Greece. The officials have discussed an agreement that would pave the way for the next payment of aid funds to the debt-stricken country.\nNext Payment\n\u201cIt seems extremely likely Greece will be getting its next tranche of aid,\u201d Richard Franulovich , a senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) in New York, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s what drove this spike.\u201d\nThe Dollar Index (DXY) fluctuated after a report showed sales of new homes in the U.S. rose to a two-year high in September. Sales climbed 5.7 percent to a 389,000 annual pace, the most since April 2010, following a revised 368,000 rate in August, Commerce Department data showed.\nThe index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S. trade partners, was little changed at 80.027 after rising for the past four days.\nFed Meeting\nFed Chairman Ben S.

The dollar gained 2.8 percent.\nThe cost for European banks to borrow in dollars held near the lowest in a week, with the three-month cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, slipped to 25.3 basis below the euro interbank offered rate after touching 30 basis points below, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has traded between 24 and 30 basis points below euribor since Oct. 15.\n\u201cI\u2019m quite impressed with the resilience of the euro,\u201d Alan Ruskin , global head of Group-of-10 foreign-exchange strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in New York, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe last time equities were trading at these type of levels, the euro was trading at the $1.26 area.\u201d\nGerman Confidence\nThe Ifo institute said its German business climate index dropped to 100 this month, from 101.4 in September.\nA composite index based on a survey of purchasing managers in manufacturing and services industries in the euro area declined to 45.8 from 46.1 in September, London-based Markit Economics said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast an increase to 46.5. A number below 50 indicates contraction.\nThe krona dropped versus its major peers after the National Institute of Economic Research said Swedish consumer confidence index declined to minus 2.9 in October from 2 the previous month. The median prediction of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was 1.7.\nThe krona lost 0.8 percent to 6.6978 per dollar and fell 0.5 percent to 8.6727 per euro.\nKoruna, Aussie\nThe Czech koruna weakened for a fifth day against the euro as concern rose the country will fail to cut the budget deficit. The currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 25 per euro, extending its five-day retreat to 1 percent.\nThe Australian dollar gained versus all of its 16 most- traded counterparts after an industry report signaled a slowdown in Chinese manufacturing was abating, and as local data showed consumer prices rose more than economists forecast last quarter.

(JPM) to HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) is headed for a 15.4 percent gain this year, poised to exceed the unprecedented 15.2 percent in 2009, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. The bonds are beating industrial notes by 4.3 percentage points in 2012, the biggest outperformance ever.\nSpeculation is growing that the rally has pushed yields down to levels that fail to compensate for the risk that the global economy slows further and Europe \u2019s debt crisis worsens, hurting a global banking system that\u2019s increasingly interconnected. Pimco (PTTRX) , which 15 months ago said the bonds had room to rise, now is selling the debt, favoring energy and building materials instead.\n\u201cThe rally in financial debt is mostly over,\u201d Mark Kiesel , global head of corporate bond portfolios at Pimco, said yesterday in a Bloomberg Television interview. \u201cWe\u2019re taking profits; we\u2019re reducing our exposure overall.\u201d\nThe gap in relative yields between dollar-denominated financial and non-financial bonds is at about the tightest level since February 2008, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. The difference reached 34 basis points on Oct. 17, before widening to 39 basis points as of Oct. 22.\nIMF Forecast\nThe International Monetary Fund has lowered its global growth forecast to the slowest pace since the 2009 recession. Concern that Europe may cause an international financial contagion is mounting as Spain\u2019s economy contracts for a fifth quarter and Greece struggles to obtain international aid.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see the catalyst for further tightening in bank spreads,\u201d said Bonnie Baha, head of global developed credit at Los Angeles-based DoubleLine, which oversees more than $45 billion. \u201cThey\u2019ve had a terrific run this year.\u201d\nElsewhere in credit markets, the cost of protecting corporate debt from default in the U.S. increased, with the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, climbing 0.3 basis point to a mid-price of 97.2 basis points as of 11:10 a.m. in New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.\nPlains Bonds\nThe measure typically rises as investor confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.\nThe U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of debt market stress, fell 0.75 basis point to 10 basis points as of 11:11 a.m. in New York. The gauge narrows when investors favor assets such as company debentures and widens when they seek the perceived safety of government securities .\nBonds of Plains Exploration & Production Co. are the most actively traded dollar-denominated corporate securities by dealers following yesterday\u2019s $3 billion offering, with 260 trades of $1 million or more as of 11:14 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\nLehman Failure\nThe company\u2019s $1.5 billion of 6.875 percent securities due February 2023 sold at par increased to 100.8 cents on the dollar to yield 6.77 percent, Trace data show.\nFinancial obligations are on pace for a fourth year of gains after tumbling 7.4 percent in 2008 as the failure of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ignited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. The notes have returned 12.3 percent this year compared with an 8 percent increase for non-financial borrowers.\nYields on JPMorgan\u2019s corporate bonds have declined by 1.69 percentage points this year to an average of 2.27 percent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. Yields on HSBC have dropped by 1.92 percentage points to 3.12 percent.\nThe extra yield investors demand to own financial bonds globally rather than government debt has dropped 185 basis points since year-end to 183 basis points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. That\u2019s almost three times the 66 basis-point drop to 131 basis points for industrial firms from AT&T Inc. to Toyota Motor Corp.\nRelative yields for financial firms have plunged from as high as 686 basis points in March 2009, index data show. Industrial spreads peaked at 494 basis points in December 2008.\nBernanke, Draghi\n\u201cBecause the valuations have changed, we\u2019re no longer as excited about the return prospect,\u201d Pimco\u2019s Kiesel said in an interview at Bloomberg headquarters in New York.\nInvestors have been buying riskier debt with the Federal Reserve holdings its benchmark interest rate in range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.\nFed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said Sept. 13 that policymakers expected to hold down the target through mid-2015 and committed to buying $40 billion of mortgage bonds a month. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi announced an agreement on Sept. 6 for an unlimited bond-buying program to tamp down interest rates and fight speculation of a currency breakup.\nInvestment-grade bond fund inflows this year of $105 billion compare with $74 billion in all of 2011, according to JPMorgan research.\nVolcker Rule\nBanks are reducing debt as the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s Volcker Rule in the U.S. seeks to limit risk-taking at the biggest financial institutions and after the 27-country Basel Committee on Banking Supervision raised minimum capital requirements in 2010.\nAllianceBernstein LP\u2019s Ashish Shah sees potential for further gains as banks cut their debt levels, leading to a shrinking supply of the notes. Relative yields on financial notes that are wide compared with historical averages also make the notes attractive, he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a healthy spread premium versus any history,\u201d said Shah, head of global credit investments at the New York-based firm, which oversees about $245 billion in fixed- income assets.\nBank bonds yielded an average of 33 basis points less than industrials in the five years before Lehman\u2019s failure on Sept. 15, 2008. Since then, yields on financial notes have been an average 77 basis points higher than industrial debt.\n\u201cIt tended to be a higher quality sector back then,\u201d said Brian Machan, a money manager with Aviva Investors North America in Des Moines , Iowa , who helps oversee $433 billion.\nSpain, Greece\n\u201cThere are scenarios where you could see that happen again,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think at this point though. You still have Europe as a big concern.\u201d\nThe IMF is predicting the world economy will grow 3.3 percent this year and 3.6 percent next year, it said on Oct. 9.

That missed the 1.21 billion-euro median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts.\nSantander and other Spanish banks are still recognizing losses on real estate as they respond to government orders to purge assets that piled up on their balance sheets after the country\u2019s property boom turned to bust . Declining profit in Brazil (SANB11) , where loan losses have also surged this year, and a slump in the U.K., where Santander earlier this month abandoned plans to build its business by buying branches from Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, also hurt group earnings as loans and deposits shrank in Spain.\n\u201cThese were a very weak set of results,\u201d Benjie Creelan- Sandford, an analyst at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in London who rates Santander underperform, said in a phone interview today. \u201cThe bottom line was impacted by the additional provisions for construction and real estate, but if you look at the underlying operational trends they were disappointing.\u201d\nSantander Chief Executive Officer Alfredo Saenz pointed to a quarter-on-quarter drop in Brazilian loan impairments and data that showed net new Spanish mortgage defaults declining as signs the lender has its asset quality under control. He said external aid for Spain would help cut financing terms for governments and banks and that Santander would probably participate in sales of nationalized lenders next year.\nNon-Performing Loans\nBad loans as a proportion of total lending rose to 4.33 percent from 4.11 percent in June, the bank said. The bad-loan ratio across the Spanish business climbed to 6.38 percent from 5.98 percent in June and 5.15 percent a year earlier. The ratio for its branch network in the country climbed to 9.56 percent from 9.16 percent three months earlier.\nBad loans in Spain will probably peak in the first quarter of 2014 at about 7.2 percent, Saenz told reporters at the bank\u2019s headquarters near Madrid today, adding that he was giving the estimate \u201cwith every right to get it wrong.\u201d\nReal Estate\nSantander\u2019s real estate risk fell by 5.5 billion euros over the first nine months of the year to 26.5 billion, the bank said. The default ratio for real estate-linked lending surged to 42.8 percent from 39.4 percent in June.\nSantander said it covered 90 percent of the cleanup of its real estate ordered by the government this year as it charged 5 billion euros against earnings for losses on its property assets and 9.53 billion euros for non-performing loans in the first nine months of the year. Impairment charges for the third quarter rose to 2.99 billion euros from 2.71 billion euros a year ago, the lender said.\nSantander\u2019s core capital ratio was 10.38 percent in September compared with 10.1 percent in June.\nSantander fell 0.3 percent to 5.76 euros at 4:26 p.m. in Madrid, paring gains this year to 10 percent and valuing the company at 59.7 billion euros. Shares in Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , Spain\u2019s second-biggest bank that reports earnings Oct. 31, have fallen 2.9 percent in 2012.\nSpanish Loans\nLending in Spain shrank 4.5 percent from June and deposits contracted 2.6 percent, Santander said. Earnings from its Spanish branch network jumped to 266 million euros from 101 million euros a year earlier.\n\u201cThe numbers on Spanish loans and deposits are disappointing especially because Santander is seen as a safe haven in Spain,\u201d said Creelan-Sandford.\nProfit from the U.K. slumped 21 percent to 337 million euros in the quarter, while Brazilian earnings dropped 9 percent to 537 million euros as loan impairment charges jumped to 1.51 billion euros from 1.24 billion euros, Santander said. The bad loans ratio for Brazil climbed to 6.79 percent from 6.51 percent in June.\nNet interest income across the group rose a quarterly 3 percent to 7.5 billion euros, Santander said.\nEarnings from Banco Espanol de Credito SA, a listed Spanish retail banking unit of Santander, rose to 32 million euros from 22 million euros a year ago, according to today\u2019s statement. The bad loans ratio for the unit rose to 5.74 percent from 5.27 percent in June as lending fell an annual 8.5 percent and deposits 3.4 percent.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Charles Penty in Madrid at cpenty@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Frank Connelly at fconnelly@bloomberg.net\nSantander\nAngel Navarrete/Bloomberg\nBanco Santander SA, Spain\u2019s biggest bank, said third-quarter profit fell a greater-than-estimated 94percent after purging more soured real estate and as earnings fell in the U.K. and in Brazil, its biggest market.\nBanco Santander SA, Spain\u2019s biggest bank, said third-quarter profit fell a greater-than-estimated 94percent after purging more soured real estate and as earnings fell in the U.K. and in Brazil, its biggest market.

Details still need to be worked out for the program, which will add to the planned 207 billion euros ($269 billion) of 2013 gross issuance.\nSpain\u2019s central government has already bailed out the regions with more than 40 billion euros this year as most of the 17 states were locked out of public debt markets. The regions, which owe a combined 151 billion euros, risk adding to the burden on Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy just as he decides whether to seek a second European rescue.\n\u201cThe government will likely have to finance the regions entirely next year,\u201d said Justin Knight, a European rate strategist at UBS AG in London .\nAndalusia, the region that is the third-biggest contributor to Spain\u2019s economy, urged the government yesterday to help states finance themselves. The central administration, which lent regions money to pay their suppliers earlier this year, created a temporary fund of as much as 18 billion euros in July to allow them to meet debt redemptions.\nRegional Demands\n\u201cIf financial markets\u2019 attitude doesn\u2019t change, regions will demand from the government a new fund or measures to help their treasuries,\u201d Miguel Angel Vazquez Bermudez, Andalusia government spokesman, said by telephone yesterday.\nFinancial markets are \u201ctotally closed\u201d as \u201cmarkets see the regions\u2019 fund as a way to have a single interlocutor, which is the central government, and aren\u2019t interested in other financial operations with the regions,\u201d he said.\nThe region of Madrid , which has one of the lowest budget deficits and the second-largest economy, was forced to drop plans this week to sell more of its 2020 bond because of weak demand. The sale was planned for Oct. 23, the same day Moody\u2019s Investors Service\u2019s downgraded the credit ratings of five regions, citing \u201cdeterioration in their liquidity positions.\u201d\nStill, Madrid hasn\u2019t requested aid from the central government as it can access markets, a spokesman for its economy department, who asked not to be named in line with policy, said in e-mailed answers to questions today. Foreign investors bought most of the 653 million euros raised through bilateral funding operations in the last two weeks, including an 80 million-euro operation yesterday, he said.\nMadrid Rating\nMadrid\u2019s regional government had its Baa3 ranking confirmed by Moody\u2019s. That is one level above junk and the same rating that Moody\u2019s assigns to Spain. Standard & Poor\u2019s also rates Spain one level about junk and Fitch Ratings has it two steps above non-investment grade.\nUBS estimates that between the regions\u2019 needs and deficit slippage, Spain\u2019s gross bond issuance requirements will be about 135 billion euros next year, dwarfing the 85 billion euros planned in Spain\u2019s 2013 budget, based on its own calculations. Spain\u2019s Treasury hasn\u2019t provided a breakdown of how the 207 billion euros of total gross issuance will be divided into bills and bonds.\n\u201cThere probably won\u2019t be enough buyers for those bonds,\u201d Knight said.\nSpain\u2019s central government continues to sell debt via auctions and sold more than it had targeted at a sale on Oct. 23.

A large, \u201cclumsy\u201d bad bank will be at a \u201ctremendous\u201d disadvantage and will generate losses that Spaniards will have to pay for.\nThe country has until the end of next month to establish the institution, a condition for receiving 100 billion euros of external aid for the financial system it requested in June. Premier Mariano Rajoy \u2019s government seeks to purge about 180 billion euros of bad assets that the Bank of Spain says are on  the balance sheets of lenders . The government has said the bank  will be profitable and won\u2019t cost taxpayers .\nThe bad bank will not take deposits and so won\u2019t be able to provide financing to potential buyers of its assets, Antonio Carrascosa, director general of the state run FROB bank-rescue fund, said in an Oct. 18 interview at a Barcelona conference.\nLatest Data: Bloomberg's European Debt Crisis Page\nThe aim is to place soured real estate loans and other assets in the vehicle for as long as 15 years in the hope that, once cleansed of bad property bets, banks can resume lending and reactivate an economy mired in its second recession since 2009. The bad bank will have to compete with healthier lenders that have set up units to sell their own problem assets and can provide credit, known as vendor financing, to potential buyers.\nFinancing Agreements\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be a bank and the only way it may be able to achieve sales with attractive mortgages is by reaching financing agreements with other banks, which will be competing to deleverage their own real estate,\u201d said Fernando Acuna Ruiz, managing partner of Taurus Iberica Asset Management in Madrid .\nAcuna, whose company oversees 60,000 foreclosed properties on behalf of 25 banks, said that while the structuring will be in place by December, it will be \u201cmammoth,\u201d with tens of thousands of assets and loans to service and transfer onto its books. \u201cIntegrated management won\u2019t be up and running for 12 to 24 months after,\u201d he said.\nKnown by its Spanish acronym SAREB, it will have as much as 90 billion euros of assets based on their transfer price, initially comprising land, developer loans and residential units that went bad after Spain\u2019s decade-long real estate boom turned to bust, an Economy Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity told reporters on Oct. 17.\nTransfer Valuations\nThe Bank of Spain has yet to fix transfer valuations for the assets based on the stress tests of Spanish lenders carried out by management consultants Oliver Wyman and published on Sept. 28. The 90 billion-euro number is based on transfer prices, so the original value of the assets is likely to be higher.\nIn comparison, Ireland\u2019s National Asset Management Agency, set up in 2009, spent 32 billion euros on mortgages with a face value of 74 billion euros to cleanse its banking system.\nLenders that take state aid will have to transfer to the bad bank foreclosed property of more than 100,000 euros, real estate and builder loans of more than 250,000 euros and controlling stakes in property firms, according to the Economy Ministry official. A decree to regulate the entity should be passed on Nov. 16. It may be amplified in the future to include loans to consumers, small- and medium-sized enterprises and retail mortgages.\n\u2018Consume Capital\u2019\n\u201cIt will need a legion of lawyers, notaries and debt servicers to ensure properties and loans have no legal issues and change title documents,\u201d Echavarren said by telephone. \u201cBy the time they find out what and where the assets are, they won\u2019t have any idea of what they have and what to do with it for at least a year.\u201d\nThe vehicle won\u2019t have the resources to manage assets, which are like \u201clivestock that consume capital,\u201d he said. Holding the assets cost money in taxes, maintenance and security and will generate losses for Spaniards.\nSpain is considering giving tax breaks to the bad bank, two people familiar with the matter said. They asked not to be named because the information isn\u2019t public.\nA lack of financing options will also hamper the bank, Echavarren said. \u201cA bad bank can try to compete by slashing prices but as a buyer if you can\u2019t get a loan, and the bad bank won\u2019t be able to provide them, you can\u2019t buy full stop.\u201d\nThe FROB, which will be a shareholder in the bad bank, is searching for investors to take at least 51 percent of the vehicle, an onerous task, according to analysts including Krista Davies at Fitch Ratings .\nSkeptical Investors\n\u201cEquity investors in the private sector are likely to be skeptical of the benefits to be drawn from investing in a wind- down vehicle,\u201d Davies wrote in an Oct. 22 report. \u201cAs SAREB purchases will take place during a period of uncertainty around economic development in Spain, there is likely to be only a small number of potential private investors in SAREB.\u201d\nJaime Guardiola, chief executive officer of Banco Sabadell SA, told reporters today in Madrid that more details about the bad bank are needed before it can decide on a possible role for the vehicle. Banco Santander SA (SAN) Chief Executive Officer Alfredo Saenz said he has concerns over the transfer price of assets, though they are based on incomplete information.\nConcerns about Spain\u2019s creditworthiness have grown since the government, which is struggling to trim a 2011 deficit that was more than three times the EU limit, requested as much as 100 billion euros in European Union aid in June to shore up its lenders and its economy contracted for a fifth quarter.\nRatings Reviews\nOn Oct. 17 Spain avoided joining euro-region peers Cyprus, Portugal, Ireland and Greece as being rated below investment grade by Moody\u2019s Investors Service as it concluded a review for a possible further downgrade of Spain initiated in June. Standard & Poor\u2019s lowered Spain\u2019s ratings to BBB- on Oct.10.\nAccording to Carrascosa, the bad bank \u201ccannot make losses in the short, mid or long term.\u201d As well as reaching accords with banks participating in the vehicle, the bad bank will need to reach agreements with other \u201chealthy\u201d financial institutions to arrange vendor financing, he said.\nIt also hasn\u2019t ruled out selling homes individually.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t set up offices all over Spain because it\u2019s too big so we\u2019ll try to sell packages of assets to institutional investors and not individual apartments,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we have to set up agreements with real estate agents, we could do it. Flexibility and profitability are the two key words.\u201d\nSantander\u2019s Success\nThe bad bank\u2019s limitations stand in contrast to Santander, Spain\u2019s largest lender. The company advertises homes on its Altamira real estate website for as little as 40,000 euros in Madrid and apartments complete with swimming pool and garage on the coast of Moncofar in Valencia for 65,100 euros. The lender offers 40 year mortgages with loan to values of as much as 100 percent.\nThe strategy is paying off. Proceeds from sales of homes on its balance sheet reached 1.3 billion euros in the second quarter -- almost as much as the total for the whole of 2011, according to Saenz who said on July 26 that sales are taking place at discounts of as much as 45 percent. Santander has reduced its exposure to Spanish real estate to 26.5 billion euros from 42.5 billion euros in 2008, the bank said today in a results presentation .\nBanco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , Spain\u2019s second-largest lender, last year created BBVA Real Estate to handle its 30 billion euros of property assets.\n\u2018Market Prices\u2019\n\u201cOur policy is to sell at market prices with 100 percent financing,\u201d Ignacio San Martin, head of research at BBVA Real Estate, said on Oct. 19. The bank is selling more houses than last year, though said that for large institutional investors, the bank prefers buyers to provide their own financing. \u201cThat way we don\u2019t hold the loan on our books or have to provision them.\u201d\nSabadell, a Catalan lender, sold 708 million euros of properties via its Solvia real estate unit in the first nine months of the year, up from 433 million a year earlier. The company is aiming for sales of 1.19 billion euros this year, according to an earnings presentation by the lender today.\nThe strategy works well for healthy banks, according to Fernando Rodriguez de Acuna Martinez, a partner at Acuna & Asociados, a real estate consulting firm in Madrid. If nationalized banks that transfer assets to the bad bank were forced to provide vendor financing for sales, it would perpetuate the subprime lending that initially got them into trouble.\n\u201cAs a nationalized bank, you\u2019d be looking at an asset that came to you via way of default, so do you really want to be forced to finance its sale again to get it out of the bad bank?\u201d he said during a telephone interview.\nAcuna said the best discounts are on the worst assets, where demand comes only from people with a low credit rating .\n\u201cSo they are subprime or less than subprime borrowers and if you give them credit, you are assuming bad risk again. It\u2019s a vicious circle as you are financing the very assets and debtors that got you in trouble in the first place.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Sharon Smyth in Madrid at ssmyth2@bloomberg.net .\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Andrew Blackman at ablackman@bloomberg.net ; Rob Urban at robprag@bloomberg.net .\nSpain Bad Bank Seen Too Big to Work With $117 Billion\nAngel Navarrete/Bloomberg\nSpain\u2019s efforts to sell as much as 90 billion euros ($117 billion) of toxic property assets it uses to create a bad bank from lenders that take state aid will be mconstrained by the size and inability to provide credit to potential buyers, adding to the risk of taxpayer losses.\nSpain\u2019s efforts to sell as much as 90 billion euros ($117 billion) of toxic property assets it uses to create a bad bank from lenders that take state aid will be mconstrained by the size and inability to provide credit to potential buyers, adding to the risk of taxpayer losses.

The securities would automatically count toward lenders\u2019 efforts to meet the standard, which will require banks to hold enough easy- to-sell assets to survive a 30-day credit squeeze.\nThe European Banking Authority, the London-based agency that sets standards for bank regulation across the 27-nation EU, would be tasked with designing how to protect the status of the government-backed bonds, according to the document, which was prepared by Cyprus\u2019s EU Presidency and dated Oct. 22.\nEU nations are in negotiations with the European Parliament over how the bloc will implement the Basel III global banking accords, ahead of an international end-of-the-year deadline. The draft law sets minimum capital requirements and asks the EBA to design how the new liquidity ratio will apply to banks across the EU.\nConcerns that mounting losses on real estate held by banks could burden government finances helped push Spain into seeking a European bailout of as much as 100 billion euros ($130 billion) to shore up its financial system in June. Ireland received an international bailout in 2010.\nThe draft EU law specifically cites the need to protect bonds on banks\u2019 balance sheets that were issued by Ireland\u2019s National Asset Management Agency, or NAMA, and by the Spanish Asset Management Company, also known as the FROB.\nScale Back\nBanks have cautioned that the liquidity measure may force them to scale back loans to businesses if left unchanged. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi has also criticized the proposed standard, saying it would discourage banks from lending to each other.\nThe liquidity coverage ratio is scheduled to take effect in 2015, and is under review by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision .\nThe EU\u2019s implementation of the LCR should be \u201ccomparable\u201d to what is agreed on in the Basel committee, according to the document.\nStill, the EBA should weigh \u201cpossible unintended consequences\u201d of the measure on central banks\u2019 ability to apply their monetary policies, according to the document.\nEBA should also assess whether the standard might lead lenders to offer lower-quality assets as collateral to central banks, and whether the standard might harm interbank lending.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jim Brunsden in Brussels at jbrunsden@bloomberg.net ; Rebecca Christie in Brussels at rchristie4@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anthony Aarons at aaarons@bloomberg.net ; James Hertling at jhertling@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IBVC", "embersId": "70b1016fe7cbb0cdc5dc589977fe728f47e035c5"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-24 03:35:26", "postDate": "2012-10-24", "author": "Cornelius Rahn", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-24/sap-lifts-2012-revenue-target-as-software-sales-beat-estimates.html", "title": "SAP Lifts 2012 Revenue Target as Software Beats Estimates", "updateTime": "2012-10-25 20:41:08", "content": "SAP Lifts 2012 Revenue Target as Software Beats Estimates\nBy Cornelius Rahn - 2012-10-24T07:35:26Z\nSAP AG (SAP) , the biggest maker of business-management software, reported third-quarter software license revenue that beat analyst estimates and boosted a sales forecast. The stock rose the most in more than three months.\nSales of new software licenses, an indicator of future revenue, rose 12 percent to 1.03 billion euros ($1.3 billion) excluding currency swings, the Walldorf, Germany-based company said in a statement today.

The company will make the power available to miners in Katanga, he said.\nMining companies in the southern province, where deposits have some of the world\u2019s richest grades of copper and cobalt, have been forced to buy power from neighboring Zambia and use generators to meet production targets.\nGlencore International Plc (GLEN) \u2019s Katanga Mining Ltd. (KAT) is investing more than $300 million to rehabilitate power lines and a hydroelectric plant that will guarantee about 450 megawatts of power for their projects by 2016. Some of the power will also go to Glencore\u2019s Mutanda and Kansuki copper and cobalt projects, which will reimburse part of Katanga\u2019s costs.\nFreeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) \u2019s Tenke project, the largest copper producer in the country, needs another 200 megawatts of power to eventually increase production to more than 400,000 metric tons of the metal a year, Andre Kapanga, Tenke\u2019s head of external relations, told the conference.\nNo Goal\nWithout immediate investment in power, Congo\u2019s Mines Ministry can\u2019t achieve its goal of almost tripling copper output to 1.5 million tons in 2016, Kapanga said. Congo\u2019s copper production could rise to more than 600,000 tons this year from 520,000 tons last year, Barthelemy Mumba Gamba, provincial mines minister for Katanga, said yesterday.\nGecamines will use some of the power from the plant to increase its own copper production to 100,000 tons a year from about 30,000 tons, Nkand said. Talks on financing are \u201cvery advanced,\u201d Nkand said without naming the potential backers. Gecamines will hand over management of the plant to Congo\u2019s state-owned electric company or another management group, he said.\nThe company is also in talks with the Development Bank of Southern Africa about securing $270 million in financing, which may be concluded by December, he said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Michael J.

Freeport-McMoRan declined 3.9 percent to $38.98. Halliburton dropped 3.2 percent to $33.47.\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s GSCI spot gauge of 24 raw materials fell for a third consecutive session, dropping 1.4 percent today.

The planned proposal will show how to meet the long-term climate objective, according to the document.\nThe commission said last year that the most cost-efficient way to reach the 2050 target would be to lower pollution by 40 percent in 2030 and 60 percent in 2040. While most EU countries have voiced support for the so-called low-carbon road map by the commission, Poland vetoed a ministerial declaration backing the future emissions-reduction trajectory twice.\nThe planned 2030 framework for climate could also impact emission caps in the EU emissions trading system, a cornerstone of the bloc\u2019s climate policy. The program, known as the EU ETS, imposes pollution caps on about 12,000 utilities and manufacturing companies in the region, leading to a cap on discharges in 2020 that will be 21 percent below 2005 levels.\nUnder existing EU law pollution limits in the cap-and-trade program will fall by 1.74 percent annually as of 2013. That will lead to a \u201cjust over 70 percent reduction\u201d in the ETS cap by 2050, which is not consistent with the long-term objective, according to a draft report on the state of the EU carbon market obtained by Bloomberg News and due to be published by the commission next month.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Ewa Krukowska in Brussels at ekrukowska@bloomberg.net ; Aoife White in Brussels at awhite62@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Lars Paulsson at lpaulsson@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IGBVL", "embersId": "6e7069426aed6c72b4893824df4c3dce48a355b8"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-23 09:33:16", "postDate": "2012-10-23", "author": "Andrew Davis , Chiara Vasarri", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-23/italy-may-delay-vat-rise-if-economy-gains-cnbc-reports.html", "title": "Italy May Delay VAT Rise If Economy Gains, CNBC Reports", "updateTime": "2012-10-25 20:42:30", "content": "Italy May Delay VAT Rise If Economy Gains, CNBC Reports\nBy Andrew Davis and Chiara Vasarri - 2012-10-23T13:33:16Z\nThe Italian government could delay a planned increase in the value-added tax to 22 percent should economic conditions improve, Undersecretary for Finance Gianfranco Polillo told Class CNBC in a television interview.\n\u201cShould the economic situation improve in the coming months, the increase in VAT by 1 percentage point in July 2013 could be frozen,\u201d Polillo said on Class CNBC today.\nPolillo also said the government is trying to \u201cresolve the problems that have affected the management of Finmeccanica, separating those issues from the good working of the company.\u201d Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) is being targeted in corruption investigations in Italy that contributed to the resignation of Pier Francesco Guarguaglini, the former chairman and chief executive officer of the country\u2019s largest defense contractor.

The commission will also determine the cost-effectiveness of repairing or replacing the generators.\nThe regulator \u201crealizes the importance of the San Onofre nuclear plant to the state of California and the consequences of the problems with the plant for ratepayers and for all affected,\u201d Michael R.

The shutdown has cost Rosemead, California-based Edison $165 million in inspection, repair and replacement power expenses through June 30, according to a July presentation to investors.\nThe U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has determined that faulty computer modeling and manufacturing issues contributed to tube wear at the plant, located about 60 miles (97 kilometers) south of Los Angeles.\nRestart Plan\nEdison, which owns 78.2 percent of San Onofre and operates the plant, needs permission from federal regulators to resume power output from the two units, capable of generating 2,200 megawatts of electricity. The company proposed on Oct. 4 to run Unit 2 at reduced power for five months, while Unit 3 remains shut for further study.\nDamage is more extensive at its Unit 3 reactor, where a pipe ruptured and released trace amounts of radioactive steam in January.\nSempra Energy (SRE) owns 20 percent of the plant and the city of Riverside, California, owns the remaining 1.8 percent.\nMitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011) built the steam generators, which were installed in Unit 2 in January 2010 and Unit 3 in January 2011 at a cost of $671 million.

(GS) risk losing as much as $190 million in advisory fees if the Canadian government rejects C$23 billion ($23.2 billion) of planned takeovers.\nCanada turned down a C$5.2 billion bid by Malaysia\u2019s state- owned oil company for Calgary-based Progress Energy Resources Corp. (PRQ) on Oct. 19, raising concern that a $15.1 billion bid for Nexen Inc. (NXY) by Cnooc Ltd. (883) of China may face the same fate. BCE Inc. (BCE) \u2019s C$3 billion takeover of Astral Media Inc. (ACM/A) was rejected by Canada\u2019s broadcast regulator a day earlier.\nInvestment bankers on both sides of the three deals stand to make as much as $190 million in advisory fees, according to estimates by New York-based Freeman & Co. , which specializes in mergers consulting in the financial industry. Freeman uses its own model to estimate bank fees based on deal size, industry and nature of the transaction.\n\u201cIn the case that the deals fail, adviser banks may get paid a small percentage, depending on negotiation, of the total fees,\u201d Lam Nguyen, a director at Freeman, said yesterday. \u201cIn addition, banks advising the target side may split a percentage, depending on negotiation, of the breakup fees if there are breakup fees.\u201d\nProgress Energy and Kuala Lumpur-based Petroliam Nasional Bhd., or Petronas, have been speaking with government officials in Ottawa this week on how to resolve the impasse. The government ruled the Petronas purchase doesn\u2019t provide a \u201cnet benefit\u201d to Canada.\nProgress Costs\nProgress said estimated fees and costs from its takeover are not expected to exceed C$22.7 million, according to regulatory filings. The amount includes  \u201cemployee obligations,\u201d fees to Bank of Montreal (BMO) \u2019s BMO Capital Markets as its financial adviser and Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) for a fairness opinion, as well as legal fees and other costs, according to the July 20 filing.\nPaul Deegan, a spokesman for Toronto-based Bank of Montreal, declined to comment. Scotiabank spokesman Joe Konecny didn\u2019t immediately provide a comment.\nThe potential combined advisory fees for both sides on the Progress-Petronas deal are estimated at $40 million to $50 million, Freeman\u2019s Nguyen said.\nTransaction costs for Petronas, which is being advised by Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Lynch unit, haven\u2019t been disclosed. Kerrie McHugh, a bank spokeswoman, declined to comment.\n\u2018Success Loaded\u2019\nInvestment bankers have the most to lose if deals fail, said Frank Turner, co-chairman of the corporate group at Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP law firm.\n\u201cThey\u2019re the ones whose compensation is typically most tied to a successful outcome,\u201d Turner said in a phone interview from Calgary yesterday. \u201cFor the financial advisers on the sell side, the banking fee is usually success loaded.\u201d\nBCE, Canada \u2019s largest telecommunications company, agreed in March to buy Montreal-based specialty broadcaster Astral to bolster its French-language programming. The deal was rejected Oct. 18 by the Canadian Radio-television Telecommunications Commission, which said it would have given Montreal-based BCE too much control. While BCE has asked the federal government to intervene to overturn the regulator\u2019s ruling, it will have to pay Astral a C$150 million break fee if the deal fails.\nThat\u2019s creating huge uncertainty for bankers, lawyers and anyone else doing deals in Canada, said Mirko Bibic, BCE\u2019s chief legal officer.\n\u2018Investment Climate\u2019\n\u201cI think people are going to be asking themselves what is the investment climate today and what is it going to be tomorrow if the markets and investors don\u2019t have the clarity around what rules exist and if there\u2019s going to be any consistency in their application,\u201d Bibic said in an Oct. 22 phone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s a fundamental issue that we really need to look at carefully.\u201d\nAstral said transaction costs were estimated at C$14.7 million, including C$7.1 million in fees to financial advisers. Royal Bank of Canada (RY) and Montreal-based National Bank of Canada (NA) advised Astral.\nBank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce advised BCE. CIBC spokesman Tom Wallis and National Bank spokeswoman Joan Beauchamp declined to comment. Mark Langton, a BCE spokesman, declined to say how much BCE\u2019s advisers stand to lose from a failed deal.\nFreeman\u2019s Nguyen estimates potential total advisory fees for both sides on the Astral-BCE takeover are $30 million to $40 million.\nWork Fees\nBankers will not entirely lose out if a deal fails. \u201cThere\u2019s usually a work fee, but the majority of the fee is on a contingent basis on the success or completion of the deal,\u201d Eric Castonguay, a managing director at PwC in Toronto, said in a phone interview yesterday.\nWork fees are usually non-refundable and are typically fixed monthly to help cover costs for banks working on the transaction, Castonguay said. Bankers may also get part of any break fees if a deal doesn\u2019t go through, he said.\nCnooc\u2019s takeover of Nexen also faces a government review under the Investment Canada Act. The act requires the government to consider foreign takeovers valued at more than C$330 million to determine whether they are in the country\u2019s interest and provide a \u201cnet benefit\u201d to Canada.\nNexen Costs\nNexen estimates fees, costs and expenses tied to the Cnooc takeover to be about C$81.7 million. That includes fees to its financial advisers, New York-based Goldman Sachs, and Royal Bank, the country\u2019s biggest bank. Royal Bank spokeswoman Gillian McArdle and Michael DuVally , a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, declined to comment.\nThe potential advisory fees for both sides in the Nexen- Cnooc deal are estimated at $80 million to $100 million, Nguyen said.\nCnooc, which is being advised by Bank of Montreal and Citigroup Inc., said yesterday it\u2019s assuming the Nexen purchase will get approved.

(ALLY) for as much as C$3.8 billion. About 20 minutes later Toronto-Dominion said it would buy Target Corp. (TGT) \u2019s $5.9 billion U.S. credit-card portfolio. Combined with Scotiabank\u2019s C$3.1 billion agreement in August to buy the Canadian unit of ING Groep NV (INGA) , the country\u2019s three largest lenders by assets are on the biggest buying spree since 2010.\nBankers including Toronto-Dominion Chief Executive Officer Edmund Clark , 65, have warned that domestic consumer banking profit may slow next year with household debt levels at a record. The Toronto-based lenders, ranked the soundest for the past five years by the World Economic Forum , have also looked to asset management and foreign banking to increase earnings.\n\u201cThe banks have now realized they no longer can just go out there and cross-sell their way to better growth; they are going to have to go out and acquire assets,\u201d Craig Fehr , a strategist at Edward Jones & Co., said in an interview yesterday in Bloomberg\u2019s Toronto office.\nCanada\u2019s six biggest banks agreed to spend $7.07 billion on 13 takeovers announced last year and $16 billion in 23 deals in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nAuto Financing\n\u201cWhile we have a very good market in Canada, there are great opportunities elsewhere,\u201d Scotiabank CEO Richard Waugh said in an interview after a conference in Toronto yesterday. \u201cThat\u2019s where Scotiabank has been looking, and also at a few opportunities in Canada.\u201d\nRoyal Bank was little changed at C$57 at 4 p.m. in Toronto while Toronto-Dominion fell 0.8 percent to C$81.44. Scotiabank was little changed at C$53.55. The eight-member Standard & Poor\u2019s/TSX Commercial Banks Index has risen 6.8 percent this year, outperforming the 2 percent gain of the S&P/TSX Composite Index.\nRoyal Bank, Canada \u2019s largest lender by assets, said yesterday it plans to buy Ally\u2019s Canadian auto-finance and deposit business in a cash deal that Ally said will generate $4.1 billion for the Detroit-based company. RBC said the total price will range from C$3.1 billion to C$3.8 billion, depending on the size of a dividend taken by Ally before the deal is completed. It would be the largest takeover ever for Royal Bank, eclipsing a $2.16 billion purchase of Centura Banks in 2001.\nTaxpayer Bailout\nAlly put its non-U.S. operations up for sale in May to help repay a $17.2 billion taxpayer bailout that left the U.S. government with a 74 percent stake.\nRoyal Bank said it expects the Ally business to generate C$120 million in profit, excluding C$50 million in one-time costs, and \u201cmodestly\u201d add to per-share earnings in the first year. The acquired business will have a return on equity in the \u201chigh single digits,\u201d said David McKay, head of personal and commercial banking. Combined, RBC\u2019s auto-lending business will have a return of 15 percent or more, he said.\nRBC is buying a business that offers inventory financing to more than 580 auto dealerships across Canada, the lender said. RBC said it will have C$24 billion in auto loan receivables and offer financing to more than 890 dealerships after this transaction, expected to close in the first quarter of 2013.\n\u201cIt speaks to a very healthy, profitable banking industry that is well-capitalized and has the ability to expand, so I think that is a real positive.\u201d McKay said in a phone interview. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing the Canadian banks with capital to deploy based on strong performance that are able to expand.\u201d\n\u2018Good Demonstrations\u2019\nThe transaction, as well as TD Bank\u2019s card acquisition, are demonstrations of the \u201ccapital allocation theme that drives our thinking for 2013,\u201d Mario Mendonca , an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said yesterday in a note. \u201cWe believe that with capital strength established across the industry, investors will become intensely focused on capital allocation.\u201d\nSome banks will return capital in the form of \u201csignificant\u201d buybacks while others, especially Toronto- Dominion and Scotiabank, are more likely to invest in growth, Mendonca said.\nToronto-Dominion said its pact with Minneapolis-based Target will significantly expand the bank\u2019s presence in the North American credit-card business. TD agreed to a seven-year deal to underwrite, fund and own consumer loans made with the retailer\u2019s Target- and Visa Inc.-branded credit cards in the U.S.\n\u201cWe think it makes financial sense, because it leverages our deposit base,\u201d said Michael Rhodes, Toronto-Dominion\u2019s executive vice president of North American credit cards and merchant services. \u201cIt makes strategic sense because we have a lot of interest in expanding our North American card business.\u201d\nToronto-Dominion, which has more branches in the U.S. than Canada, said the transaction will help it meet a forecast for $1.6 billion in U.S. consumer-banking profit by next year.\nSlowing Consumer\n\u201cThe Canadian consumer cannot constantly leverage themselves up, and so we had a pretty classic leverage-driven expansion in Canada that aids the banks,\u201d Clark said at a conference in Toronto in September. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see slower growth.\u201d\nYesterday\u2019s buying binge compares to one in 2007, when the country\u2019s two biggest lenders announced deals valued at about $9 billion within minutes of each other. On Oct. 2 that year, Royal Bank agreed to buy RBTT Financial Holdings Ltd. in Trinidad and Tobago while Toronto-Dominion agreed to buy Commerce Bancorp Inc.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Sean B.

These include making amends to victims, publicly admitting wrongdoing, reforming practices and paying a fine.\n\u201cDeferred Prosecution Agreements will give prosecutors an effective new tool to tackle what has become an increasingly complex issue,\u201d Green said in an e-mail. \u201cThis will ensure that more unacceptable corporate behavior is dealt with, including through substantial penalties, proper reparation to victims, and measures to prevent future wrongdoing.\u201d\nFraud costs the U.K. 73 billion pounds ($116 billion) a year, Green said.\nThe DPAs will be overseen by a judge, agreed on in open court and the outcome will be published to ensure transparency, the Ministry of Justice in London said in a statement. If, at the end of the period, the prosecutor is satisfied the organization has met its obligations, there will be no prosecution.

A sharing agreement could also help Telefonica to reach a better valuation for its Munich-based unit, whose IPO is scheduled for Oct. 30 and from which it seeks to raise as much as 1.68 billion euros ($2.2 billion).\nTelefonica Deutschland told investors yesterday it could share network infrastructure with E-Plus that runs second- generation and faster third-generation networks, adding that it\u2019s in talks with two out of its three rivals and that a deal probably won\u2019t be reached before early next year.\n\u2018Closer Look\u2019\n\u201cWe\u2019re generally open to ideas for cooperation,\u201d said E- Plus spokesman Guido Heitmann . \u201cWhenever we see opportunities, we\u2019ll have a closer look.\u201d\nA hypothetical merger of E-Plus and Telefonica Deutschland could generate synergies worth about 4 billion euros, according to a document prepared by one of the banks managing the IPO and obtained by Bloomberg News . KPN last year said that such a deal may generate 3 billion euros of synergies.\nTelefonica Chief Executive Officer Cesar Alierta is reversing a decade-long international expansion of the Madrid- based company by selling assets, including parts of its Latin American business, as he seeks to avert a further debt-rating cut for a company that has more than 58 billion euros of net debt.\nThe Spanish operator is considering more deals to share parts of local mobile-phone networks following an agreement to set up a 50-50 venture in the U.K. with Vodafone, a person with knowledge of the matter said in June. The U.K. venture follows a more extensive merger by Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom , which pooled their British wireless assets and brands into Everything Everywhere in 2010.\nMarket Consolidation\nTelefonica and KPN, the biggest phone companies of Spain and the Netherlands respectively, had explored a combination of their German units as the former Dutch phone monopoly was fending off an unsolicited offer by Carlos Slim \u2019s America Movil SAB. (AMXL) America Movil reached the 28 percent stake it sought in KPN in June.\nTelefonica Deutschland doesn\u2019t see any major regulatory barriers to the deals it\u2019s exploring, said a person familiar with the management\u2019s plans, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.\nGermany\u2019s Federal Network Agency, which could block a deal if \u201ccompetitive independence\u201d may be harmed, in principle allows the operation of common infrastructure or the sharing of frequencies. Such agrements may also have to be reviewed by Germany\u2019s cartel office.\nSpectrum Sharing\nTelefonica Deutschland told investors yesterday it may seek to split spending on wireless equipment for the 800 megahertz spectrum with other operators. Those frequencies were obtained in 2010 by Telefonica, Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone to blanket rural areas with faster long-term evolution, or LTE, connections. E-Plus didn\u2019t purchase that spectrum during the auction.\nTelefonica is offering as many as 258.8 million shares of Telefonica Deutschland at 5.25 euros to 6.50 euros each. The IPO values the German business at as much as 7.3 billion euros. Most orders for the IPO were coming in the mid- to low-end of the price range , two people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News on Oct. 19.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Manuel Baigorri in Madrid at mbaigorri@bloomberg.net ; Ruth David in London at rdavid9@bloomberg.net ; Cornelius Rahn in Frankfurt at crahn2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IGBVL", "embersId": "3eaab87ee2d9b347bd0e4d71a939e068aba1cb91"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-25 08:33:10", "postDate": "2012-10-25", "author": "Marie Mawad", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-25/france-telecom-cuts-dividend-projection-as-earnings-drop.html", "title": "France Telecom Cuts Dividend Projection as Earnings Drop", "updateTime": "2012-10-25 20:43:38", "content": "France Telecom Cuts Dividend Projection as Earnings Drop\nBy Marie Mawad - 2012-10-25T12:33:10Z\nFrance Telecom SA (FTE) , the former French monopoly still paying one of the highest dividends among European phone companies, will reduce its payout so it can control debt as cheaper competitors hurt sales and profit.\nThe owner of the Orange brand, saying it\u2019s coping with a more difficult environment than expected, will pay a dividend of at least 80 cents ($1.04) each for 2012 and 2013, as much as 41 percent lower than last year. The cut is the second this year and marks a drop from a 2011 dividend of 1.40 euros.\nFrance Telecom, trying to avoid credit-rating cuts, follows rivals including Telefonica SA (TEF) in cutting payouts as competition and Europe \u2019s debt crisis crimp sales and margins . In France, which accounts for about half of France Telecom\u2019s sales, smaller carriers, led by Iliad SA (ILD) , have fought it with discounts.\n\u201cOur priority is to keep our debt under control, it\u2019s important for us to keep our credit rating,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Gervais Pellissier said on a conference call. \u201cOur acquisition policy will be selective, and in France we\u2019re shifting from cost-control to looking to reduce costs.\u201d\nChief Executive Officer Stephane Richard refocused on preserving cash eight months ago, when the company cut its dividend forecast for the first time and abandoned a promise to buy back shares. Still, the Paris-based company faces the threat of having its credit rating cut for the first time since 2002 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, which said in August that the company may have trouble sustaining its debt ratios.\nDebt Ratio\nFrance Telecom shares fell 2.9 percent to 9.05 euros at 2:32 p.m. in Paris. The stock lost 23 percent this year through yesterday, while Iliad gained 24 percent.\nWhile the dividend cut should help support credit ratings, France Telecom will have a tough time achieving its targeted debt level because of competition in France, said Sam Morton, a strategist at Mizuho Financial Group Inc.\nThe phone company forecast it will reduce net debt to a ratio close to twice earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by the end of 2014, compared with 2.2 times at the end of this year. Third-quarter Ebitda declined to 3.65 billion euros, while sales fell 3.5 percent to 10.8 billion euros, in line with analyst estimates .\nIliad Growth\nAt home, France Telecom competes against Vivendi SA, Bouygues SA and Iliad. The latter, founded by Xavier Niel, scooped up 5.4 percent of the French market in its first six months by selling cheap packages starting at 2 euros a month.\nFrance Telecom said its operating cash flow would only grow again in 2014, once pricing pressure stabilizes in France. Meanwhile, operating cash flow will be more than 7 billion euros next year, from a target of close to 8 billion euros in 2012.\nThe dividend cut is set to bring France Telecom\u2019s yield nearer to its peers. An unchanged dividend at yesterday\u2019s closing price would have meant a yield of about 15 percent, double the industry average .\nCompetitors in the telecommunications business, an industry which has paid generous dividends historically, have also curbed payouts. Spain\u2019s Telefonica suspended its dividend in July, and Dutch carrier Royal KPN NV cut its payout forecast the same month. Telekom Austria AG last month reduced its dividend projection for the second time in less than 10 months, citing increased competition.\nMaroc Telecom\nFrance Telecom, which has also shied away from acquisitions this year to hoard cash, will not be blind to opportunities at the right price, CEO Richard said during a conference with financial analysts.\nThe company\u2019s policy for acquisitions involves consolidating its existing positions or gaining market share in high-growth countries, CFO Pellissier said.\nFrance Telecom will \u201cmost probably\u201d make an indicative offer for TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) \u2019s Spanish unit Yoigo and would look at Vivendi\u2019s Moroccan phone business Maroc Telecom SA if it were for sale, Richard said. He described any plans around Maroc Telecom as \u201ccomplicated,\u201d given France Telecom\u2019s stake in Meditel, Morocco \u2019s second-largest operator.\n\u201cWe thought cutting the dividend was a necessity to manage our debt situation, not for the M&A agenda,\u201d Richard said. \u201cStill, we should have the discipline to seize opportunities within the financial frame we have defined on debt and dividend.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Marie Mawad in Paris at mmawad1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net\nFrance Telecom Cuts Dividend Projection as Sales, Earnings Drop\nBalint Porneczi/Bloomberg\nFrance Telecom SA's Orange logo is seen on display at a mobile phone store in Paris.

(AMXL) Separately, a group of lawmakers last week proposed a bill that would restrict any one company from controlling more than 30 percent of the wireless market, which could force Mexico City-based America Movil to break up or return airwave licenses.\nA regulatory crackdown in Colombia, where America Movil has about 60 percent of mobile users, would handicap the company in its third-largest market and one of its most lucrative. The carrier said the market-cap proposal would increase client costs and an auction ban would crimp its business. Just last year, Slim, the world\u2019s richest man worth more than $76 billion, was praising Colombia \u2019s openness to foreign investment.\n\u201cIt will basically sentence the company to a slow death,\u201d Juan Carlos Archila, president of America Movil\u2019s Colombia unit, said of the proposal by rivals to keep the company from the auction. \u201cThe company would have immense limitation to compete in the market,\u201d he said in an interview.\nThe proposed bill seeking to cap market share, introduced by Jorge Robledo, an opposition leader in the Senate, is backed by 18 other lawmakers, said Roy Barreras, president of Colombia\u2019s Congress. Barreras, a member of the ruling party who supports the proposal, said there\u2019s a good chance the bill will pass.\nTelefonica, Empresa\nIf the market-share cap proposal is approved, America Movil would shed its less profitable customers, losing interest in clients in rural and poor neighborhoods, said Jose Otero , an analyst at Signals Telecom Consulting in Montevideo, Uruguay. The company\u2019s network investment would drop and coverage expansion would slow, he said. Once its smaller competitors neared the 30 percent mark, they too would have little incentive to grow, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a measure that doesn\u2019t benefit the consumer in any way,\u201d Otero said.\nThe move to sideline America Movil from the wireless airwave auction for so-called fourth-generation service was included in an early document for the auction plan, America Movil\u2019s Archila said.\nSlim Visit\nSlim, 72, is scheduled to arrive today in Cartagena, Colombia, said Arturo Elias , the billionaire\u2019s spokesman, in an e-mail. He said he didn\u2019t know the nature of Slim\u2019s visit.\nCompetitors Telefonica SA (TEF) , which has 26 percent of Colombia\u2019s mobile-phone subscribers, and Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogota said America Movil, operating under the Claro brand (BRND) , uses its size in Colombia to keep customers from switching providers.\nETB advocates keeping Claro out of the auction, which had been tentatively scheduled for December.\nAmerica Movil offers discounts to users for calling within Claro\u2019s network, so it\u2019s more expensive to phone customers of other networks, said ETB President Saul Kattan. That makes Colombians more likely to choose Claro, he said in an interview.\n\u201cWith the dominance they have in voice, with 4G they\u2019re going to easily get dominance in data,\u201d Kattan said.\nWhile the government is unlikely to block America Movil outright from participating in the 4G auction, it could require the company to accept undesirable conditions to bid, said Otero, the Signals Telecom analyst. The carrier could be asked to participate in infrastructure-sharing agreements with rivals, or to allow competitors without their own wireless towers to roam on its networks, he said.\n\u2018More Cautious\u2019\n\u201cThe conditions may cause them to be more cautious in investing. If they can\u2019t roll out LTE, we\u2019re talking about a delay in their strategy to offer high-speed data,\u201d Otero said.\nAmerica Movil\u2019s licenses to operate its mobile-phone network are up for renewal in 2014, which would offer the government another opportunity to impose those conditions on the carrier, he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s little room for them to maneuver,\u201d Otero said.\nAmerica Movil gained less than 1 percent to 16.94 pesos at the close in Mexico City. The shares have gained 7.1 percent this year.\nPresident Juan Manuel Santos \u2019s government is reviewing the auction-ban proposal, Information Technology and Communications Minister Diego Molano has said. Molano accepted and then canceled several interview requests by Bloomberg.\nMexican Attempts\nThe Colombian proposals go beyond regulatory attempts in Slim\u2019s home market to contain the power of America Movil, which has 70 percent of Mexican mobile-phone subscribers. That nation\u2019s antitrust agency agreed this year to drop a $1 billion fine against Slim\u2019s company for anticompetitive behavior in exchange for concessions such as lower fees to connect calls from competitors.\nIn Brazil , Latin America \u2019s largest economy, regulators blocked sales of new plans by America Movil and two competitors for 11 days until they presented investment plans to address customer complaints.\nWhile Mexico and Brazil account for almost two-thirds of America Movil\u2019s sales, the company\u2019s Colombia and Panama division makes up 8.6 percent of revenue and is one of the company\u2019s most profitable markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Colombian unit recorded a profit margin last year of about 47 percent, leaving out interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nStill Concentrated\nThe Colombia government hasn\u2019t done enough to act on a 2009 ruling that declared America Movil the dominant carrier, said Alfonso Gomez, president of Madrid-based Telefonica\u2019s Colombian division.\n\u201cThe only thing that has happened is that the market keeps on being concentrated,\u201d he said in an interview.\nLawmakers and regulators are only pressuring America Movil because of lobbying by the company\u2019s competitors, America Movil\u2019s Archila, said.\n\u201cWhat should be asked is if the way to promote competition is by eliminating the leading competitor,\u201d he said.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Oscar Medina in Bogota at omedinacruz@bloomberg.net ; Crayton Harrison in Mexico City at tharrison5@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IGBVL", "embersId": "709030fe26cb69a09a69267a8bae22ddc75af534"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-24 16:48:22", "postDate": "2012-10-24", "author": "Carla Simoes", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-24/brazil-said-to-consider-mobile-fee-cuts-to-bolster-competition.html", "title": "Brazil Said to Consider Mobile Fee Cuts to Aid Competition", "updateTime": "2012-10-25 20:43:41", "content": "Brazil Said to Consider Mobile Fee Cuts to Aid Competition\nBy Carla Simoes - 2012-10-24T20:48:22Z\nBrazil is considering cutting the fees mobile-phone companies charge to accept incoming calls from rivals to boost competition, a government official said.\nThe changes under review would reduce costs for smaller companies such as NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD) , allowing them to offer more competitive rates to attract users from bigger carriers from Telefonica SA (TEF) to Tim Participacoes SA, said the official, who asked not to be named because a final decision is yet to be made. Anatel, the industry regulator, probably will vote on the changes as soon as Nov. 1, the official said. Tim shares fell in Sao Paulo , while NII recovered losses in New York.\nA reduction in interconnection fees could shrink Brazil\u2019s base of mobile-phone subscriptions, according to Barclays Plc and Banco Itau BBA SA. The current fees are so high that Brazilians typically have multiple mobile-phone lines so they can call other users at in-network rates. Out-of-network calls cost an average of 70 percent more than in-network, so 85 percent of mobile-phone traffic in Brazil is in-network, according to the government official.\n\u201cIf Anatel announces this, it\u2019s going to have a strong impact on the companies, from the point of view of the way they handle billing as well as their share prices,\u201d said Pedro Galdi , chief strategist at SLW Corretora in Sao Paulo, in a phone interview.\nThe changes Anatel is considering include eliminating completely the interconnection fee NII pays, the official said. Reston, Virginia-based NII, which operates a walkie-talkie-like service under the Nextel brand in Latin America , won airwaves last year in a government auction to begin offering 3G wireless service to compete more directly in the mobile-phone market. The company is expected to begin offering the new third-generation services in November, the official said.\nMarket Leaders\nTelefonica Brasil SA, the local unit of the Madrid-based company, had 30 percent of Brazil\u2019s 256 million mobile-phone lines at the end of June, making it the No. 1 carrier. Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3) had 27 percent, America Movil SAB had 25 percent and Oi SA (OIBR4) had 19 percent, according to Anatel. NII had 4.2 million Brazilian subscribers at the end of June.\nAnatel\u2019s press office declined to comment, as did Oi\u2019s, Telefonica\u2019s and America Movil\u2019s. Representatives of Tim and NII didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nTim Drops\nTim, based in Rio de Janeiro , dropped 4 percent to 6.95 reais at the close in Sao Paulo, the lowest price since January 2011. NII rose 2 percent at $7.11 in New York after earlier dropping as much as 5 percent.\n\u201cIf Nextel wants, it can manage to become competitive,\u201d said Valder Nogueira, chief analyst at Banco Santander SA in Sao Paulo, in a phone interview. \u201cAnatel\u2019s decision provides an opening for Nextel to enter the market.\u201d\nAmerica Movil gained less than 1 percent to 16.94 pesos in Mexico City, Telefonica Brasil fell 1.2 percent to 43.54 reais, and Oi was little changed at 8.21 reais.\nUnder the rules Anatel is considering, a mobile-phone carrier would only have to pay interconnection fees to a competitor if it gets 40 percent or more of the incoming calls in traffic between the two companies, the official said. The change could reduce the overall costs of mobile interconnection fees, known in Brazil as VU-M, by 20 percent, the official said.\nIn addition, Anatel may decide to directly reduce the rate for interconnection fees, the official said.\nThe fees generate about 8 percent to 21 percent of each carrier\u2019s revenue in Brazil, according to an Oct. 3 report by Vera Rossi, a Barclays analyst in New York . The fees should be cut by 50 percent to 80 percent to match the level of other Latin American countries, where they range between 3 and 9 U.S. cents a minute, she said.\nCutting the fees would reduce the \u201cexclusive-club\u201d advantage that big carriers get by encouraging users to make in- network calls, Itau said in an Oct. 4 report.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Carla Simoes in Brasilia Newsroom at csimoes1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Crayton Harrison at tharrison5@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IGBVL", "embersId": "ca6ce273f9735a69c51cd0bf6d78a8fd46f7032f"}], "MERVAL": [{"postTime": "2012-10-25 12:22:29", "postDate": "2012-10-25", "author": "Stephan Nielsen", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-25/brazil-to-boost-ethanol-mixture-to-25-percent-by-june-anp-says.html", "title": "Brazil\u2019s Ethanol Blend Won\u2019t Spur Investment, Analyst Says", "updateTime": "2012-10-25 20:43:48", "content": "Brazil\u2019s Ethanol Blend Won\u2019t Spur Investment, Analyst Says\nBy Stephan Nielsen - 2012-10-25T16:22:29Z\nBrazil \u2019s plan to boost to 25 percent its required mix of ethanol with gasoline may not spur investments in production capacity, according to Arnaldo Correa, executive director of the Sao Paulo-based research company Archer Consulting.\nThe higher blend, due to take effect by June, will increase demand for anhydrous ethanol by 1.7 billion liters (449 million gallons) a year, Correa said today in a telephone interview.\nSugar-cane processors are reluctant to build new mills because the government sets the price of gasoline, Correa said.

It reverses a plunge earlier this year that made it the worst- performing stock in Brazil. HRT and Petrobras, as the state-run producer is known, are studying pipelines and other projects to transport fuel from Brazil\u2019s Solimoes Basin, HRT Chief Financial Officer Carlos Tersandro Adeodato said yesterday.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have Petrobras involved it goes nowhere,\u201d Eric Conrads, who manages $1 billion in Latin American equities for ING Groep NV, said in a telephone interview from New York . Petrobras owns the only pipeline in the area capable of transporting gas to consumers. \u201cThe gas monetization of Solimoes has been a pretty good boost for the story,\u201d he said.\nPetrobras and newer oil explorers including HRT, OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA and QGEP Participacoes SA (QGEP3) raised at least $76.4 billion in share sales in the past four years after the Americas\u2019 biggest oil discovery in three decades was made off the coast of Brazil. The companies have underperformed the benchmark Bovespa index this year as Petrobras delayed projects, OGX cut output estimates and HRT found only gas and no oil at its Solimoes Basin blocks.\nStock Declines\nRio de Janeiro-based HRT jumped 6.3 percent to 6.38 reais at 1:05 p.m. in Sao Paulo, after earlier rising to the highest since July 3. Today\u2019s gain pares HRT\u2019s year-to-date loss to 44 percent. OGX, controlled by billionaire Eike Batista , declined 63 percent since the start of the year, making it the worst performer on the Bovespa index. QGEP, which held Brazil\u2019s biggest initial public offering last year, is down 29 percent, while the Bovespa gained 1.5 percent.\nPetrobras and HRT announced Oct. 15 that they are studying ways to market gas reserves that HRT found near Petrobras\u2019s Jurua field in the Amazon, without providing details of the projects being considered.\nHRT\u2019s exploration of Solimos has been in partnership with TNK-BP, BP Plc\u2019s Russian venture with a group of billionaires. Kremlin-run OAO Rosneft announced on Oct. 22 it had agreed to buy TNK-BP from the two groups in a $55 billion cash and shares deal.\nThe companies are looking into liquefied natural gas and gas-to-liquids projects, as well as fertilizer and power plants that would use the gas produced in the region, HRT CFO Adeodato said yesterday in an e-mailed response to questions. HRT plans to release a report compiled by Degolyer & MacNaughton, an oil- auditing company, on its Solimoes reserves next year, he said.\nHRT and Petrobras will study the technical, economic and environmental viability of gas projects in Solimoes, Petrobras said in an e-mailed response to questions Oct. 22. Petrobras declined to comment further yesterday.\n\u2018Good Discoveries\u2019\nHRT has announced \u201cgood discoveries\u201d in the area and the companies are evaluating ways to collaborate, Petrobras Chief Executive Officer Maria das Gracas Foster told reporters on Oct. 16 in Rio de Janeiro , where the company is based.\n\u201cHRT has some proposals for monetizing these reserves, shipping this gas,\u201d Foster said. \u201cWe have an agreement to evaluate the potential -- it\u2019s not binding.\u201d\nPartnering with Petrobras could make HRT\u2019s Solimoes blocks profitable even if it doesn\u2019t find oil in the area. HRT has so far made five discoveries of only natural gas, which sells for less than crude and is more difficult to transport.\nPetrobras pumps more than 90 percent of Brazil\u2019s oil and gas, while HRT hasn\u2019t started production yet. HRT owns 55 percent of the Solimoes Basin blocks and TNK-BP, Russia \u2019s third- largest oil producer, holds the rest.\n\u201cIf the agreement advances, Petrobras\u2019s capacity and experience in the Solimoes basin are a positive for HRT,\u201d T.J. Conway, a research and advisory manager at New York-based Energy Intelligence Group, said by telephone from Washington .\nLow on Cash\nHRT, with a market value of $872 million, doesn\u2019t have the cash to build the infrastructure needed to transport gas from the Amazon on its own, Itau analysts Paula Kovarsky and Diego Mendes said in an Oct. 15 research report. HRT may be forced to accept a below-market price for the fuel should Petrobras offer to buy the gas rather than allowing the company to use its pipeline, they said.\n\u201cBased on past experience, the offer is likely to come at low prices,\u201d they said in the report and confirmed the comments by e-mail. \u201cThe fact that HRT\u2019s current cash position is insufficient to keep up with the needed investments on its own reduces the company\u2019s bargaining power to negotiate with Petrobras or any other potential partner at this point.\u201d\nHRT declined to comment on the Itau report.\n\u2018Cash Burn\u2019\nHRT said Oct. 2 it may sell a minority stake in the onshore Solimoes blocks after $804 million of spending since 2011 turned up no commercial oil. HRT raised about $1.5 billion in an initial public offering two years ago, estimating at the time that its blocks in Brazil and Namibia may hold a combined 1.53 billion barrels of oil and equivalents.\nThe company has enough cash to fund operations until the second half of 2014 and is optimistic about finding oil in the region as it expands exploration to the eastern part of the basin, Chief Executive Officer Marcio Mello said last month.\nGaining access to Petrobras\u2019s infrastructure may help it reduce HRT\u2019s \u201ccash burn,\u201d ING\u2019s Conrads said.\n\u201cYou finally have some positive news,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction for this company.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Peter Millard in Rio de Janeiro at pmillard1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jessica Brice at jbrice1@bloomberg.net ; James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net\nPetrobras Chief Executive Officer Maria das Gracas Foster\nJonathan Ernst/Bloomberg\nPetrobras Chief Executive Officer Maria das Gracas Foster told reporters on Oct. 16 that HRT has announced \u201cgood discoveries\u201d in the area and the companies are evaluating ways to collaborate.\nPetrobras Chief Executive Officer Maria das Gracas Foster told reporters on Oct. 16 that HRT has announced \u201cgood discoveries\u201d in the area and the companies are evaluating ways to collaborate.

The shares rose the most in a year.\nSuez Environnement\u2019s decision to keep the dividend unchanged contrasts with larger competitor Veolia Environnement , which plans to trim its payout to 70 euro cents a share this year and next, from 1.21 euros. Both utilities have seen demand for industrial waste collection slump after manufacturers shuttered factories to survive the economic slowdown.\nSuez Environnement\u2019s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization dropped to 1.77 billion euros in the first nine months of the year from 1.85 billion euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company said today in a statement.

The four-year contract may be worth $36 million in sales, Veolia said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new trend for municipalities in the U.S. to look to get help from the private sector for operations,\u201d Auguste said yesterday. \u201cAnd it is part of our focus to find a different approach to the market.\u201d\nPrivate investment in the $90 billion U.S. municipal water market has been \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d in part due to the perception that \u201cprivate companies running the U.S. water system is not a good thing,\u201d Auguste said.\nBusiness Model\nVeolia has developed a model where the company offers management expertise and leverages its global purchasing network to help public utilities reduce costs and improve operations based on performance-based goals, Auguste said. Unlike a traditional public-private partnership, Veolia only assists public utility workers and doesn\u2019t take over the operations of the water system, he said.\nVeolia\u2019s U.S. sales rose 9.2 percent to $899.8 million for the first six months of this year compared with the same period a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nUnder its contract with New York City, the company has identified more than 10 percent in potential savings out of the city\u2019s $1.2 billion budget, Auguste said.\nVeolia also plans to expand its industrial business in the U.S. through water treatment for oil and gas production, he said. Veolia and Suez Environnement, also Paris-based, are the two largest water companies.\nThe inaugural BNEF water forum is a two-day event featuring executives from the energy, fracking and power sector including municipalities discussing management strategies and regional water scarcity issues that wraps up today.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Mark Chediak in San Francisco at mchediak@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Susan Warren at susanwarren@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "CHILE65", "embersId": "b895a9c5482539c85470bbc6c960d137f473358c"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-23 03:52:55", "postDate": "2012-10-23", "author": "Phoebe Sedgman", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-23/iron-ore-to-gain-in-fourth-quarter-as-chinese-mills-restock-1-.html", "title": "Iron Ore Set to Gain in Fourth Quarter as Chinese Mills Restock", "updateTime": "2012-10-25 20:49:28", "content": "Iron Ore Set to Gain in Fourth Quarter as Chinese Mills Restock\nBy Phoebe Sedgman - 2012-10-23T07:52:55Z\nIron ore will probably advance this quarter to levels last seen in July as steelmakers in China , the biggest buyer, rebuild inventories on speculation that the country\u2019s pace of economic growth will pick up, said UBS AG.\nPrices for ore delivered in China may climb to about $120 a ton to $125 a ton, commodities analyst Tom Price said today.

Growth will rebound to 7.7 percent in this quarter, the median of economists\u2019 estimates in a Bloomberg survey shows. Premier Wen Jiabao on Oct. 17 said the economy has started to stabilize. Steelmakers raised daily output to a three-month high in September, according to monthly data collated by the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\u201c China\u2019s economy is still functioning, it still needs steel and it\u2019s still going through a materials-intensive growth cycle,\u201d Price said from Sydney. \u201cI\u2019m expecting a seasonal restocking of raw materials and a lift in steel production.\u201d\nInfrastructure Plans\nIron ore slumped 22 percent in the third quarter, plunging to a near three-year low of $86.70 on Sept. 5, on concern slowing growth in China will curb demand. It has rebounded 35 percent since Sept. 6, when the country announced plans to boost infrastructure spending. The government also raised planned rail-infrastructure investment this year to 516 billion yuan ($83 billion) on Oct. 10, from an earlier 496 billion yuan.\nChina boosted iron ore imports 4.1 percent to 65.01 million metric tons in September, the highest since January 2011, according to the customs bureau. Inventories of the ore held at Chinese ports have dropped 3.7 percent to 96.35 million tons as of Oct. 12, from a record 100.1 million tons set in July, according to data from Shanghai Steelhome Information.\nSteel reinforcement bar futures fell as much as 2.1 percent to 3,653 yuan a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange today on speculation steelmakers are boosting production of the construction raw material. Daily steel output climbed 2 percent to 1.93 million tons a day last month from August, the highest level since June, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\nIron ore is measured in dry tons, or metric tons less moisture.

The vote means that the Netherlands, where elections took place last month, is now unlikely to block the so-called backloading proposal, according to Bas Eickhout, a Dutch member of the European Parliament.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a significant move,\u201d Eickhout, a member of the Green group in the EU assembly, said in a phone interview from Brussels today. \u201cI expect the new government to follow the parliament\u2019s line. Theoretically it could ignore the motion but by objecting to the proposal the minister would risk being voted down.\u201d\nAt stake is the price of emission permits in the world\u2019s biggest cap-and-trade system after they plunged to a record of 5.99 euros ($7.76) in April as the economic crisis hurt industrial output, boosting the surplus of allowances to almost half of the average annual pollution limit in the 27-nation EU.\nThe strategy proposed by the commission, the EU\u2019s regulatory arm, would see fewer permits being auctioned by member states at the beginning of the next trading period that starts in 2013, a move that would help alleviate the oversupply. The postponed allowances would be returned to the market at a later stage of the so-called Phase 3 that ends in 2020.\nBackloading Measure\nThe Dutch environment ministry said in September the country will probably not support the backloading measure as it could lead to temporarily higher costs for companies in the Netherlands that compete internationally. That could indirectly be a disadvantage for the Dutch economy, the euro area\u2019s fifth- largest, the ministry said.\nThe Liberal Party of caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte is in talks to form a new government with the Labor party led by a former Greenpeace activist, Diederik Samsom. They may reach an agreement as soon as this week, NOS television reported on Oct. 22, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the situation.\nThe motion calling on the government to endorse backloading and deeper changes to the ETS was supported by 94 lawmakers in the 150-seat parliament yesterday. The Liberals, which have 41 votes, and the Freedom Party led by Geert Wilders , which won 15 seats in the elections, opposed the resolution.\n\u2018Increasing Pressure\u2019\n\u201cThere\u2019s an increasing pressure on the government to change its position,\u201d Eickhout said.\nThe proposal to delay some auctions of carbon permits in the EU emissions trading system, or the ETS, will be considered in the so-called comitology procedure, in which a measure put forward by the commission needs qualified-majority support from representatives of national governments to pass. The EU strategy to curb oversupply also includes a draft amendment to the bloc\u2019s emissions trading law to reassert the commission\u2019s right to decide about the timing of auctions.\nThe commission is planning to propose a specific number of allowances to be postponed on Nov. 14 and aims for a vote in the committee before the end of this year. The Netherlands has 13 out of 345 votes in the EU\u2019s weighted ballot system that favors larger countries. A blocking minority requires 91 votes.\nMost member states are still scrutinizing the commission\u2019s proposal after they voiced reservations about the draft law change at two meetings in September, an EU presidency official said on Sept. 24. Poland , which has repeatedly said it opposes any measure to \u201cmanipulate\u201d the ETS, has 27 votes and Slovakia, which also signaled resistance, has seven.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ewa Krukowska in Brussels at ekrukowska@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Lars Paulsson at lpaulsson@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "CHILE65", "embersId": "6846df128231f144e45bd57a237faaf9fd74b51e"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-25 08:02:43", "postDate": "2012-10-25", "author": "Tino Andresen, Aaron Kirchfeld , Sally Bakewell", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-25/eon-rwe-said-to-sell-british-nuclear-venture-to-hitachi.html", "title": "EON, RWE Said to Sell British Nuclear Venture to Hitachi", "updateTime": "2012-10-25 20:50:13", "content": "EON, RWE Said to Sell British Nuclear Venture to Hitachi\nBy Tino Andresen, Aaron Kirchfeld and Sally Bakewell - 2012-10-25T12:02:43Z\nEON AG (EOAN) and RWE AG (RWE) , Germany\u2019s two largest utilities, are set to sell their U.K. venture Horizon Nuclear Power to Japan\u2019s Hitachi Ltd.

Voimaosakeyhtioe SF, a joint venture of the smaller investors who collectively own 66 percent of the project, has begun talks with EON about future ownership, Fennovoima said in a statement on its website today.\n\u201cWe remain committed to this project,\u201d Mika Seitovirta, chief executive officer of Outokumpu Oyj, which owns a 10 percent stake in the project, told reporters today in Helsinki after EON\u2019s announcement. \u201cOf course we\u2019re looking at the return on the investment, but we have no reason to withdraw.\u201d\nPrice Rise\nNordic power prices may rise if EON\u2019s withdrawal leads to the cancellation of the reactor, according to Pareto Securities ASA. If no buyer is found it will ease an expected glut in power supplies after 2020, he wrote in an e-mail today. At the very least, it will be delayed, he said.\nFinnish nuclear operator Teollisuuden Voima Oyj\u2019s under- construction Olkiluoto-3 reactor has missed a 2009 completion deadline, and may not start operating until 2015, Anna Lehtiranta, a company spokeswoman, said last month in an interview.\nFinland is pushing ahead with plans to increase atomic output from 32 percent in 2011, even as countries from Germany to Japan begin closing reactors following the Fukushima nuclear disaster last year. Finland is investing in new capacity to reduce energy imports and provide cheap power for industry.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Torsten Fagerholm in Helsinki at tfagerholm@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Lars Paulsson at lpaulsson@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "CHILE65", "embersId": "ff64788c0b4964d43ad7d16be42de7b27731a88f"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-24 08:02:15", "postDate": "2012-10-24", "author": "Radoslav Tomek", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-24/eph-pledges-to-keep-slovak-gas-prices-steady-to-unlock-spp-sale.html", "title": "EPH Pledges to Keep Slovak Gas Prices Steady to Unlock SPP Sale", "updateTime": "2012-10-25 20:50:20", "content": "EPH Pledges to Keep Slovak Gas Prices Steady to Unlock SPP Sale\nBy Radoslav Tomek - 2012-10-24T12:02:15Z\nSlovak Premier Robert Fico said Energeticky a Prumyslovy Holding AS pledged to keep household prices steady to unlock its purchase of a 49 percent stake in the country\u2019s largest gas company.\nEPH, a Czech private-equity group, is in talks with E.ON Ruhrgas AG and GDF Suez (GSZ) on purchasing their stake in Slovensky Plynarensky Priemysel AS.

Gains in wholesale gas prices were among the main reasons for driving up energy costs, the industry group said in an e-mailed statement.\n\u201cThe role of renewables in increasing energy bills is often greatly exaggerated,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Gaynor Hartnell said. \u201cThe figures show it\u2019s our reliance on fossil fuels that is costing us dear.\u201d\nNpower will increase power rates an average 9.1 percent and gas 8.8 percent on Nov. 26 and British Gas , the biggest natural- gas and power supplier to U.K. homes, will raise prices for both an average 6 percent from Nov. 16. Both blamed higher wholesale gas costs and clean energy policies. Those gains mean renewables add an even smaller proportion to bills, equivalent to 22 pounds of the average household payment this year, the lobby said.\nPrime Minister David Cameron said Oct. 18 the U.K. would propose a measure to ensure consumers get the lowest rates, softening a remark a day earlier in which he said companies would be forced to give the lowest prices to customers.\nTo contact the reporter responsible for this story: Sally Bakewell in London at Sbakewell1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Reed Landberg at landberg@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "CHILE65", "embersId": "5907f71d28b7f2ed0b047978995d5b9a9fffcc9e"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-23 12:22:45", "postDate": "2012-10-23", "author": "Sally Bakewell", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-23/edf-affirms-year-end-u-k-nuclear-decision-needs-compeling-case.html", "title": "EDF Denies U.K. Nuclear Deal to Be Sealed in \u2018Smoke-Filled Room\u2019", "updateTime": "2012-10-25 20:50:29", "content": "EDF Denies U.K. Nuclear Deal to Be Sealed in \u2018Smoke-Filled Room\u2019\nBy Sally Bakewell - 2012-10-23T16:22:45Z\nElectricite de France SA rejected criticism that its one-to-one talks with the U.K. over the deal it\u2019ll get to build nuclear plants in the country means officials setting rates in a \u201csmoke-filled room\u201d without open scrutiny.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a dark and smoke-filled room,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Vincent de Rivaz told British lawmakers today in London. \u201cSmoking is forbidden and the light is on. We\u2019re in the process of cost discovery, which will be totally transparent. We know that it has to be auditable, that we need to face the scrutiny of parliament and the public, and we are ready for that.\u201d\nEDF is the main company negotiating with the government on a strike, or guaranteed, price for atomic power after utilities SSE Plc (SSE) , RWE AG (RWE) and EON AG gave up building nuclear plants from September 2011. Bilateral talks between the French supplier and the U.K. have been criticized by SSE Chief Executive Officer Ian Marchant as taking place over \u201cchampagne and croissants.\u201d\nEnergy Secretary Ed Davey will set final proposals before lawmakers next month to overhaul the market including plans for so-called contracts for difference guaranteeing power prices. A law, published in draft form in May, plans to curb the risk of building reactors and renewable-energy projects as Britain seeks about 110 billion pounds ($175 billion) of investment for grid upgrades and to replace aging power stations by 2020.\nEDF, Europe \u2019s biggest utility, GDF Suez SA (GSZ) and Iberdrola SA of Spain gave evidence to parliament\u2019s Energy and Climate Change Committee as U.K. atomic plans were set back this month by Areva SA\u2019s decision to halt a bid for Britain\u2019s Horizon atomic venture with China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group Co. The venture, with state backing to build plants, is being sold by RWE and EON.\n\u2018Optimal Solution\u2019\nDe Rivaz said the U.K. offered the \u201coptimal solution\u201d to fund nuclear and affirmed the company\u2019s plans to finish a final investment decision on its Hinkley Point project in Somerset by the year-end. EDF won\u2019t expose consumers to risks in building the reactor, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking consumers to take the construction risks,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cNever have we been asked for the construction risk, for instance, to be taken within the contracts for difference by the consumers.

With a net worth estimated by Forbes at $125 million, the 41-year-old American would have had a prosperous future as an endorser and motivational speaker had the evidence gathered by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency not surfaced, according to Patrick Rishe, an economics professor at Webster University in St. Louis. Nike Inc. (NKE) and his other sponsors deserted him after USADA\u2019s report.\n\u201cTo think that he would be able to make $15-$20 million annually over the next 10 years is not out of the question,\u201d Rishe said in a telephone interview yesterday. \u201cThat puts his loss in potential future earnings at between $150-$200 million.\u201d\nThe French cycling federation, which distributes Tour de France prize money on behalf of the race organizer, the Amaury Sport Organization, said yesterday it plans to cooperate with the family-owned company to reclaim the $3.8 million (2.95 million euros) it estimates Armstrong won during his career. SCA Promotions Inc., which insured bonuses Armstrong received for winning the race from 2002 through 2004, said two days ago it will seek almost $12 million.\nIncome Increase\nArmstrong earned $17.5 million in endorsement and speaking fees in 2005, when he won his last Tour de France , Sports Illustrated reported. That number grew to $21 million in 2010, Forbes said. The revenue gain as his career declined is an indication that Armstrong, who survived cancer and started the Livestrong foundation that has pumped what it says is more than $470 million into helping others with the disease, would have remained a potent corporate spokesman and health advocate.\n\u201cBut for these doping allegations, which now have been corroborated by USADA\u2019s report, he would have always been a cancer survivor and his story would have always been motivational and inspiring,\u201d Rishe said.\nThat career is in the past.\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine anyone being able to make a positive out of a relationship with him at this point,\u201d Jim Andrews, senior vice president of content strategy at IEG, a sponsorship consultant, said in a telephone interview.\nFirst Time\nPauline Juliard, a spokeswoman for the French cycling federation, said in a telephone interview that the group hadn\u2019t begun proceedings to try to recoup money paid to Armstrong. It would be the first time they have asked for money back from a rider, she said.\nArmstrong sued SCA for failing to pay his $5 million 2004 bonus. The company settled the case, paying Armstrong that money and $2.5 million in interest and court costs. SCA will work quickly to try to regain almost $12 million from Armstrong, said Jeffrey Tillotson, an attorney for the company.\n\u201cIf you have a claim, you want to pursue it as quickly and vigorously as possible, particularly if there may be other claimants,\u201d Tillotson said in a telephone interview.\nLawsuits could arise from either side, though they aren\u2019t very likely, analysts said.\nLuxottica Group SpA (LUX) , whose Oakley brand was the last major sponsor to drop Armstrong, won\u2019t try to recoup money paid to the cyclist, said company spokeswoman Cheri Quigley.\n\u2018Rebuild Cycling\u2019\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened by the situation, especially given our longstanding relationship, but we feel it is best for all involved to move on and collectively spend our energy rebuilding the sport of cycling,\u201d Quigley, who declined to discuss financial details of Armstrong\u2019s contract, said in an e-mail.\nThat\u2019s the approach Armstrong\u2019s other former major sponsors probably will take, according to Paul Swinand , an equity analyst who covers Nike for Morningstar Inc. in Chicago . It\u2019s in Nike\u2019s best interest to focus on public perception by further distancing itself from the Texan instead of pursuing more action, said Swinand, who also covers Adidas AG, Under Armour Inc. and Luxottica.\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re Nike, Anheuser-Busch, Oakley, you want to have as little noise about this as possible,\u201d Swinand said in a telephone interview. \u201cYou don\u2019t want more scabs ripped off.\u201d\nNike ended contracts with quarterback Michael Vick following his conviction for crimes related to dog fighting and with sprinter Marion Jones after a doping confession. It maintained contracts with basketball player Kobe Bryant and golfer Tiger Woods following acknowledgments of adultery.\nNike Stock\nSwinand, 45, was a semiprofessional cyclist in France in 1989-90. He said he owns no Nike shares and currently rates the stock at three-stars, a rough equivalent to a \u201chold.\u201d\nAn e-mail to Tim Herman, Armstrong\u2019s attorney, seeking comment about the French cycling federation\u2019s plans, SCA and Armstrong\u2019s endorsement deals wasn\u2019t immediately returned.\nAmong Armstrong\u2019s other former sponsors, Nike spokeswoman Mary Remuzzi, RadioShack Corp. (RSH) spokesman Eric Bruner, Honey Stinger Marketing Director Len Zanni, and Mark Riedy, a spokesman for Easton Bell Sports which makes Giro helmets and gloves, said their companies had nothing further to add to previous statements ending relationships with Armstrong.\nPhillip Cleveland , a spokesman for Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) \u2019s Michelob Ultra beer; Eric Bjorling, a spokesman for Trek Bicycle Corp.; Carli LaForgia, a spokeswoman for FRS Co.; and David Zimberoff, a spokesman for Sram International Corp., didn\u2019t respond to phone calls and e-mails seeking comment.\nUSADA Report\nUSADA released a 202-page summary of its investigation of Armstrong on Oct. 10, saying his cycling career was \u201cfueled from start to finish by doping.\u201d Nike became the first sponsor to cut ties with Armstrong on Oct. 17, shortly after he stepped down as Livestrong\u2019s chairman, and the International Cycling Union said two days ago that it would not appeal USADA\u2019s findings.\nArmstrong would have a difficult time seeking payment from the companies because of the breadth of the USADA evidence and because most endorsement deals have moral turpitude clauses that free sponsors if athletes break the law or negatively affect the sponsor\u2019s public image, according to Daniel Lazaroff, director of the Sports Law Institute at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.\n\u201cCompanies will want to get out of these high-paying contracts if the asset has lost its value,\u201d Lazaroff said in a telephone interview.\nLazaroff said he\u2019d be surprised if Nike tried to get its money back from Armstrong \u201cafter all, he provided value for them.\u201d\nPast Strategy\nArmstrong has sued those he felt lied or otherwise wronged him in the past, and he\u2019ll have to re-examine whether that\u2019s a sound strategy now, said Marc Mukasey , a partner with Bracewell & Giuliani LLP\u2019s White Collar Criminal Defense and Special Investigations practice in New York.\n\u201cI imagine that the legal fees are going to cost him a pretty penny,\u201d Mukasey said in a telephone interview. \u201cVirtually anybody who ever paid him anything, certainly with some sort of moral turpitude clause in it, is going to try to recoup. I would guess that he will be in contractual litigation for a long time.\u201d\nArmstrong has denied ever doping and says he\u2019s never failed a drug test. Any acknowledgement of drug use now is complicated by the fact that in the original SCA dispute he testified under oath that he had never doped.\nBoxed-In\n\u201cTo say under oath that you never used performance- enhancing drugs, that makes a subsequent admission and apology that much more difficult,\u201d said Mukasey, who has no involvement in Armstrong\u2019s legal representation. \u201cFrom a legal perspective, once you box yourself in like that, you better be committed to that story or have a really good excuse as to why you were mistaken or delusional at the time you gave that answer.\u201d\nWhile there remain people who believe Armstrong is innocent, it won\u2019t mean a return to sponsorships, said Paul Swangard, managing director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon.\n\u201cI see him as tainted goods,\u201d Swangard said last week in a telephone interview. \u201cThere are plenty of ways to reach your target consumer and Lance just isn\u2019t one of them anymore.\u201d\nNKE US <equity> RSH US <equity> LUX IM <equity> ABI BB <equity>\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Mason Levinson in New York at mlevinson@bloomberg.net ; Eben Novy-Williams in New York at enovywilliam@bloomberg.net ; Alex Duff in Madrid at aduff4@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Sillup at msillup@bloomberg.net\n4:48\nOct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Jim Andrews, senior vice president of content strategy at IEG, a sponsorship consultant, talks with Bloomberg's Eben Novy-Williams about Lance Armstrong's endorsement deal losses after the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency reported its evidence against the cyclist.

Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) , the region\u2019s second-biggest bank, declined 1.1 percent to 31.41 reais.\nBrazil\u2019s banks have been reducing consumer borrowing costs after President Dilma Rousseff stepped up pressure to cut interest rates. Sao Paulo-based Itau, led by Chief Executive Officer Roberto Setubal, 58, said banking fees declined to 5.01 billion reais ($2.47 billion) in the third quarter, down 0.9 percent from the previous three months and up 4.4 percent from a year earlier, according to a regulatory filing today.\n\u201cWe still see the results as negative for the stock,\u201d Carlos Firetti, an analyst at Bradesco BBI in Sao Paulo, wrote in a note to clients today. \u201cThe negative highlights were weaker fee revenues and weaker net interest income before provisions, impacted by the lower Selic rate,\u201d he said, referring to the central bank\u2019s benchmark rate.\nItau\u2019s net interest income fell to 12.8 billion reais in the third quarter, down from 13.5 billion reais in the second quarter and 12.9 billion reais a year earlier.\nRecurring net income, which excludes one-time charges, declined to 3.41 billion reais in the third quarter, or 0.76 reais a share, from 3.94 billion reais, or 0.87 reais, a year earlier, the bank said. That compares with the 0.77 real-per- share median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\nLate Payments\nThe bank\u2019s delinquency rate fell to 5.1 percent at the end of September from 5.2 percent in the second quarter. The rate was 4.7 percent a year earlier. Itau expects default rates to continue declining in the fourth quarter as Brazil \u2019s economy expands at a faster pace, Rogerio Calderon, the head of investor relations, told reporters today.\nBrazilian borrowers have been delaying debt payments because of the slowing economy, prompting the central bank to cut interest rates to a record low over the past year. Itau set aside 5.94 billion reais for bad loans in the quarter, down from 5.99 billion reais in the previous three months and higher than the 4.97 billion reais in the year-earlier period.\nItau\u2019s loan book increased 9.3 percent to 417.6 billion reais at the end of September from a year earlier. The bank reduced its portfolio of auto loans to 54 billion reais, down 4.5 percent from the second quarter and 10 percent from the previous year.\nCredit Growth\nThe lender expects credit to expand 9 percent to 10 percent this year, Calderon said.

He said Li Keming\u2019s prominent role in the agency that runs the world\u2019s biggest tobacco company may have set back efforts to control tobacco in the country.\nPublic opinion in China is becoming more important on social issues including health, environmental protection and food safety , Brookings\u2019s Li said today. China has more than 300 million smokers, and at least 1.2 million die from smoking- related diseases each year, a figure set to rise to 2 million a year by 2020, according to the report, released two weeks before China begins a once-a-decade leadership transition.\n\u201cIn all these areas, I think leaders should set examples,\u201d Brookings\u2019s Li said in an interview. \u201cParticularly now that many countries, including Russia and India , are paying more attention to public health issues.\u201d\nGovernment Revenue\nThe tobacco industry is more difficult to control because China\u2019s government gets so much revenue -- 600 billion yuan ($96 billion) in 2011 -- from it, the report said. The industry, which makes 2.3 trillion cigarettes a year, consistently contributes 7 to 10 percent of annual government revenues, according to the report.\nBrookings, a private nonpartisan research group based in Washington , got funding for the study from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation through the China Medical Board, an American foundation that seeks to advance health in China. Cheng Li is research director for Brookings\u2019s John L. Thornton China Center, where he studies China\u2019s elite politics. He dedicated the report to his brother, who died of smoking-related causes.\n\u201cParadoxically, Li\u2019s personal/family ties with the tobacco industry might have prevented him from making a real effort to constrain cigarette production and consumption in the country,\u201d Brookings\u2019s Li wrote in the report.\nMarket Control\nThe State Tobacco Monopoly Administration both runs and regulates China National Tobacco Corp., the world\u2019s biggest cigarette maker with a market share about the size of Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) and British American Tobacco Plc (BATS) combined, the report said. The STMA should be separated from China National Tobacco and the industry should have a new regulator, the report recommended.\nA person contacted by phone at the State Tobacco Monopoly in Beijing who didn\u2019t identify herself said the administration doesn\u2019t accept interview requests from foreign reporters. Li Keming didn\u2019t respond to a faxed request for comment sent to a number on the monopoly\u2019s website. Vice Premier Li Keqiang didn\u2019t respond to a faxed request for comment made to the State Council Information Office in Beijing.\nThe volume of cigarettes sold in China is expected to keep rising from 2011 to 2015, London-based researcher Euromonitor International said in July 2011. It forecast China\u2019s tobacco market will grow at an average 14 percent a year to hit 1.8 trillion yuan in retail sales in 2015, about the gross domestic product of Malaysia last year.\nChina National Tobacco controlled 97.9 percent of the domestic market in 2010, according to Euromonitor.\nTobacco Monopoly\nExecutives at the state tobacco monopoly, which also acts as a regulator, tout the cigarette industry\u2019s growth like that of any state-dominated field such as steel or telecommunications.\nThe monopoly\u2019s director, Jiang Chengkang, said on a visit to northeast China last year that the tobacco industry needed to \u201cmake new breakthroughs in technological innovation\u201d and \u201cimprove product taste and development,\u201d according to China National Tobacco\u2019s website.\nLi Keqiang\u2019s tobacco ties stand in contrast to the family of his future boss, Vice President Xi Jinping , who is set to take over as general secretary of the Communist Party at its congress next month and president next year. Xi\u2019s wife, the army folk singer Peng Liyuan, has served as an \u201cAnti-Smoking Ambassador\u201d along with basketball star Yao Ming for the Chinese Association on Tobacco Control.\n\u201cBy doing so, she can help to gain popular support and political capital for her husband to consolidate his power,\u201d Li said in the report. He said both Xi and Li Keqiang quit smoking \u201ca couple of decades ago,\u201d while 20 percent of the party\u2019s 25- person Politburo still smoke.\nActivist Efforts\nAnti-tobacco activists have scored victories in China. In 2005, China ratified a World Health Organization initiative to reduce the production and consumption of tobacco, and Health Minister Chen Zhu was recognized by the WHO in July for his tobacco-control efforts.\nChina, which according to the report has a quarter of the world\u2019s smokers, aims to ban cigarette advertising, promotions and sponsorship and raise tobacco product taxes and prices, the health ministry said in August. The country aims to cut the smoking rate among men to 40 percent by 2020 from 57 percent in 2002, the ministry said.\nThose efforts are often stymied by China National Tobacco, which skirts advertising bans through charities and sponsorships, according to anti-tobacco activists. It funds schools throughout the country, including the Sichuan Tobacco Hope Primary School, the Xinhua News Agency reported last year.\nDevastating Crisis\n\u201cChinese authorities have been slow to acknowledge this increasingly devastating public health crisis,\u201d Li\u2019s report said. \u201cTheir hesitance to effectively curtail tobacco production and consumption is driven primarily by the fact that the tobacco industry is one of the largest sources of tax revenue for the Chinese government.\u201d\nLi Keming, who has worked in the tobacco industry for three decades, gets access to top officials when he travels across China, a fact that\u2019s \u201chighly unusual in terms of Chinese bureaucratic hierarchy and protocol,\u201d Li wrote. One reason may be that local officials want to \u201ccurry favor with Li Keqiang,\u201d he said.\nLi Keqiang has told health ministry officials privately that tobacco control efforts can\u2019t be real because of the industry\u2019s contribution to the economy, according to the report, citing a conversation between Cheng Li and an unidentified public health official in 2011.\nZhejiang Visit\nLi Keming visited coastal Zhejiang province in July, when he met Communist Party Secretary Zhao Hongzhu and other officials to \u201cexchange views on the development of tobacco in Zhejiang,\u201d according to a report on the tobacco monopoly\u2019s website .\nBrooking\u2019s Li said in the interview that he hopes Li Keming \u201cwill be sensitive enough to volunteer to move to a different position, a different industry.\u201d\n\u201cChinese leaders in the future need to be sensitive about this; it\u2019s in their best interest,\u201d he said.\nTransferring Li Keming out of the tobacco industry may make his older brother less vulnerable to political attack from rivals critical of his failure to curb tobacco more effectively while overseeing public health since 2008, the report said.\n\u201cAlthough the tobacco industry -- a formidable vested interest group -- may generate some political support for Li Keqiang, his family ties with the industry may become ammunition for his political rivals,\u201d Li wrote.\nThe Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, which provided information for the report, is a partner of the Bloomberg Initiative to Reduce Tobacco Use, funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies . Bloomberg Philanthropies was set up by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Michael Forsythe in Beijing at mforsythe@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Peter Hirschberg at phirschberg@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IBOV", "embersId": "aa1d848dc014202438026e674b4281c5cf1b0e29"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-24 03:12:51", "postDate": "2012-10-24", "author": "Matthew Boyle", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-24/bat-nine-month-cigarette-shipments-fall-on-europe-and-brazil-1-.html", "title": "BAT Nine-Month Cigarette Shipments Fall on Europe and Brazil", "updateTime": "2012-10-25 20:46:47", "content": "BAT Nine-Month Cigarette Shipments Fall on Europe and Brazil\nBy Matthew Boyle - 2012-10-24T07:12:51Z\nBritish American Tobacco Plc (BATS) , Europe\u2019s largest cigarette maker, said shipments declined during the first nine months of the year because of lower consumption in Brazil and western Europe.\nThe quantity of cigarettes sold dropped to 517 billion from 523 billion a year earlier, the London-based company said today in a statement. That missed the 521 billion median estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Excluding acquisitions and disposals, the selling volume declined 1.8 percent.\nShipments in western Europe declined 5 percent, while volume fell in Brazil after a price increase in May. The maker of Lucky Strike and Pall Mall cigarettes has raised prices to offset falling tobacco consumption and increased government restrictions on smoking. The tobacco market \u201ccontinues to be challenging, with industry volumes under pressure\u201d and expansion of illicit trade remains a threat, BAT said.\nConditions in Brazil are \u201cdeteriorating\u201d after the 21 percent price boost, Nomura analyst David Hayes said in a note published prior to the results. \u201cThe government has put into place a number of interventions to try to tackle illegal trade, but how these will play out remains to be seen.

The stock has advanced 2.6 percent this year , bringing its market value to 60.7 billion pounds ($97 billion).\n\u2019Fragile Recovery\u2019\nBAT also posted declines in Japan , Italy , Turkey and Egypt , which offset gains in Bangladesh, Vietnam and Pakistan. The company\u2019s four core brands, which include Dunhill and Kent, posted a volume gain of 3 percent, a slowdown from the 8 percent advance in the same period last year.\n\u201cEconomic recovery remains fragile this year and difficult trading conditions persist in many parts of the world,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Nicandro Durante said in the statement. \u201cHowever, pricing remains strong.\u201d\nPhilip Morris International Inc., the world\u2019s largest publicly traded tobacco company, last week reported third- quarter profit that trailed estimates after sales tumbled 15 percent in the European Union, where smokers have cut back or switched to contraband cigarettes or roll-your-own varieties.\nHayes said BAT is in a \u201cbetter place\u201d in Europe as 22 percent of its profit comes from that region, a lower share than both PMI and Imperial Tobacco Group Plc (IMT) , the U.K.\u2019s biggest tobacco maker.\nTougher Restrictions\nGovernments from Europe to Asia have toughened restrictions on smoking. Australia this year became the first country to require cigarettes to be sold in plain packaging without any company logos. New Zealand and the U.K. are among countries whose governments have indicated interest in implementing similar action, which takes effect in Australia Dec. 1.\nCigarette makers including BAT and New York-based PMI are also battling a smoking crackdown in Russia, the biggest tobacco market after China, whose government is pushing an eightfold increase in cigarette taxes along with a bill that bans smoking in public places and cigarette sales in kiosks. BAT has about 21 percent of the Russian cigarette market, behind Tokyo-based Japan Tobacco and PMI.\nBAT said nine-month group revenue rose 4 percent at constant exchange rates.\nThe company said it has bought back 30 million shares so far this year for 978 million pounds ($1.6 billion).\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Matthew Boyle in London at mboyle20@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Celeste Perri at cperri@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IBOV", "embersId": "7ddfd0abe12402406d267a66625f646be27cf1ca"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-24 18:35:22", "postDate": "2012-10-24", "author": "Andrew Herndon", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-24/edf-sells-50-interest-in-minnesota-wind-farm-to-marubeni.html", "title": "EDF Sells 50% Interest in Minnesota Wind Farm to Marubeni", "updateTime": "2012-10-25 20:47:09", "content": "EDF Sells 50% Interest in Minnesota Wind Farm to Marubeni\nBy Andrew Herndon - 2012-10-24T22:35:22Z\nEDF Renewable Energy, a U.S. unit of French utility Electricite de France SA , said Japanese trading company Marubeni Corp.

Third-quarter profit excluding some items was 90 cents a share, trailing the 91-cent average of 17 analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u201cWe will generate significant savings starting in the second half of 2013,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said today on a conference call with analysts and investors. The changes are \u201cnot easy and will take some time and upfront costs to implement.\u201d\nThe biggest piece of the savings plan comes from getting rid of aging aircraft on U.S. routes and replacing 50-seat jets with larger models, Jacobson said. Trading out the small planes for used Boeing Co. (BA) 717s being bought from Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) and new Boeing 737-900ERs will reduce operating costs and put higher-fare business-class seats on more of Delta\u2019s fleet.\nDelta is also in discussions with Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) and Embraer SA (EMBR3) to buy about 70 76-set regional jets, Chief Executive Officer Richard Anderson said on the call. Delta plans to make a decision on an order by year\u2019s end, he said.\nMaintenance, Technology\nThe other major parts of the cost reduction plan call for paring maintenance expenses and making technology improvements that will lower payments to vendors and drive more customers to Delta\u2019s reservations website to book flights because that\u2019s the cheapest way to distribute tickets, Jacobson said.\nDelta slid 1.1 percent to $10.04 at the close in New York. That pared the shares\u2019 year-to-date advance to 24 percent, which was still good enough to rank third in the 10-carrier Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no growth, and you need growth to offset cost inflation,\u201d said Savanthi Syth, a Raymond James & Associates Inc. analyst in St. Petersburg , Florida . She rates Delta stock as outperform. \u201cThe cost-cutting initiative is less related to demand. There\u2019s an expectation here that you\u2019re not going to see rapid growth anywhere.\u201d\nThe airline\u2019s fleet consisted of 775 planes, with an average age of 15.6 years, at the end of 2011, according to a regulatory filing. That compared with an average of 11 years among 12 North American carriers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Jets at United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) , the world\u2019s largest airline, averaged 12.4 years of age, the data show.\nPilot Contract\nDelta would add the new regional jets under a new pilot contract that allows for more of those smaller models, Anderson said.\nDelta joins Southwest in efforts to reduce expenses after the Dallas-based carrier said last week it plans spending cuts of at least $100 million to blunt costs that are outpacing sales gains.\nExcluding fuel, Delta\u2019s cost to fly each seat a mile rose 5.6 percent last quarter for its consolidated operations, which consist of its main jet flights and its regional business. Salary and wage expenses, Delta\u2019s second-largest after fuel, climbed 7.7 percent, and maintenance jumped 15 percent.\nThird-quarter net income jumped to $1.05 billion, or $1.23 a share, from $549 million, or 65 cents, a year earlier. Delta said the one-time items in the quarter included a $440 million gain on fuel hedge accounting and charges for trimming jobs, trading airport slots and shutting the Comair regional unit.\nDelta charged more for tickets to mute the impact from a 1.2 percent decrease in miles flown by paying passengers across its network. Revenue rose 1.1 percent to $9.92 billion, lagging behind the $9.97 billion average projected by analysts.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Mary Jane Credeur in Atlanta  at mcredeur@bloomberg.net ; Victoria Stilwell in New York at vstilwell1@bloomberg.net .\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Ed Dufner at edufner@bloomberg.net\nDelta Sees $1 Billion Cost Savings, Flight Cuts as Expenses Rise\nDavid Paul Morris/Bloomberg\nExcluding fuel, the cost to fly each seat a mile rose 5.6 percent last quarter for Delta Air Lines Inc.\u2019s consolidated operations, which consist of its main jet flights and its regional business.\nExcluding fuel, the cost to fly each seat a mile rose 5.6 percent last quarter for Delta Air Lines Inc.\u2019s consolidated operations, which consist of its main jet flights and its regional business.

(VZ) from JPMorgan Securities Inc. (JPM) testified that yellow-page unit Idearc Inc. was a \u201cvery good ongoing company\u201d when it was spun off from the parent in 2006.\nYesterday\u2019s testimony came in the second week of a trial where Idearc creditors are suing New York-based Verizon for $9.8 billion, contending the spinoff entailed fraudulent transfers that left the unit insolvent immediately.\nJennifer Nason, head of JPMorgan Securities \u2019 technology, media and telecom unit, said that the bank committed to lending $250 million and still held $125 million in debt when Idearc filed for bankruptcy. Nason said she believed Idearc was properly capitalized, with about $3.5 billion in equity and $9 billion in debt.\nOn cross-examination, Nason told lawyers for Idearc creditors that JPMorgan made $36 million in fees on the financing transaction.\nAn expert witness for creditors testified last week that Idearc was insolvent by more than $1 billion when it became independent. Earlier this week, an expert witness for Verizon testified that Idearc was \u201ccompletely stable\u201d at the time of the spinoff.\nThe trial is scheduled to run through the end of the week in U.S. District Court in Dallas , where Idearc was based. The case will be decided by the judge without a jury.\nNow named SuperMedia Inc. (SPMD) , Idearc went bankrupt 28 months after the spinoff and completed a Chapter 11 reorganization with a plan creating a creditors\u2019 trust that brought the suit.\nIdearc, formerly the second-largest U.S. publisher of yellow-page directories, in January 2010 implemented a reorganization plan that was mostly worked out before the Chapter 11 filing in March 2009. The plan reduced debt to $2.75 billion from $9 billion.\nThe creditors\u2019 lawsuit is U.S. Bank National Association v. Verizon Communications Inc., 10-01842, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas (Dallas). The bankruptcy case was In re Idearc Inc., 09-31828, U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Northern District of Texas (Dallas).\nUpdates\nMarathon Wants Examiner for AMR\u2019s Embraer Settlement\nMarathon Asset Management LP is trying to block or delay a settlement under which AMR Corp. and lenders agreed to cut the costs of operating 216 smaller-capacity regional jets manufactured by Embraer SA. (EMBR3)\nThe jets are operated by American Eagle Inc., the feeder airline for American Airlines Inc.\nMarathon, based in New York , points to the period between June and November 2011, when AMR was trying to avoid bankruptcy and attempting to spin off American Eagle to shareholders. To spruce up American Eagle\u2019s balance sheet, ownership of 263 smaller jets was transferred to AMR from the regional airline.\nMarathon contends there may be fraudulent transfer claims to bring against lenders because AMR may have received less in value that it gave up when it assumed about $2.3 billion in liability on the planes. The lenders targeted by Marathon are Brazil \u2019s Agencia Especial de Financiamento Industrial and Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social.\nMarathon filed papers yesterday objecting to approval of the settlement with the financing parties. The bankruptcy court in New York will hold a hearing on Oct. 30 to consider approval.\nMarathon also asked the bankruptcy judge to appoint an examiner. Marathon says it\u2019s not advocating for lawsuits yet and only wants an examiner to say before the settlement is approved that no valuable claims are being lost.\nThe papers filed by Marathon cite AMR as saying that the aircraft transferred to the parent were worth $1.8 billion at the time, or about $400 million less than the debt AMR assumed. AMR said that American Eagle canceled some of the debt owing to the parent, so that it would be an even exchange without fraudulent transfers.\nMarathon\u2019s request for appointment of an examiner is on the Nov. 8 calendar for the New York bankruptcy court.\nFor details on proposed refinancing of the Embraer aircraft, click here for the Oct. 15 Bloomberg bankruptcy report.\nAMR, based in Fort Worth , Texas, listed assets of $24.7 billion and debt totaling $29.6 billion in the Chapter 11 reorganization begun in November. American Airlines entered bankruptcy with 600 aircraft in the mainline fleet and another 300 with American Eagle.\nThe case is In re AMR Corp., 11-15463, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).\nResCap Won\u2019t Have Borrower-Homeowner Official Committee\nWhether Residential Capital LLC should have an official committee representing homeowners was a \u201cvery close question,\u201d U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn said. He nonetheless concluded in his 16-page opinion yesterday that borrowers hadn\u2019t shown another committee is required.\nA lawyer representing 30 homeowners filed papers in late August seeking appointment of an official committee to represent borrowers. ResCap is the mortgage-servicing subsidiary of non- bankrupt Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY)\nAside from the one homeowner on the creditors\u2019 committee, the borrowers contended that everyone else on the panel has interests adverse to homeowners.\nRather than the expense attendant to having another official committee where ResCap would pay professional fees, Glenn said he favored an initiative by the creditors\u2019 committee to hire special counsel \u201cwith expertise in homeowners\u2019 foreclosure issues.\u201d\nGlenn said the creditors\u2019 panel will notify homeowners and borrowers about the availability of the special counsel. Even if there was an official borrower\u2019s committee, Glenn said it would be ethically improper for an official group to represent the interests of individual homeowners in disputes with ResCap.\nThe homeowners contend they have claims against ResCap for fraud, violation of state and federal consumer protection laws, civil claims for violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, fraudulent foreclosure and servicing misconduct.\nAuctions began yesterday, with Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) making the first bid for the mortgage-servicing business. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is to be the stalking horse for the remaining portfolio of mortgages. A hearing to approve the sales is set for Nov. 5.\nThe $2.1 billion in third-lien 9.625 percent secured notes due 2015 traded yesterday for 102.75 cents on the dollar, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The $473.4 million of ResCap senior unsecured notes due April 2013 traded on Oct. 22 for 27.063 cents on the dollar, according to Trace.\nThe case is In re Residential Capital LLC, 12-12020, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).\nCircus & Eldorado Casino Confirms Reorganization Plan\nCircus & Eldorado Joint Venture, the operator of the Silver Legacy Resort Casino in Reno, Nevada , can exit bankruptcy protection after a judge signed a confirmation order yesterday approving a Chapter 11 reorganization plan.\nConfirmation without a fight was made possible when the casino\u2019s owners reached a settlement this month with noteholder Black Diamond Capital Management LLC.\nNegotiated before the Chapter 11 filing in May with some of the noteholders, the plan restructures $142.8 million in 10.125 percent senior secured notes that matured March 1. The casino is a joint venture between MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Eldorado Resorts LLC.\nWith Black Diamond in opposition, the noteholder class originally voted down the plan. A spate of litigation ensued between the casino and Black Diamond. Ultimately, both sides dropped most claims, except Black Diamond agreed to pay the casino $325,000 for legal expenses incurred in the effort to knock out Black Diamond\u2019s opposition vote.\nWith noteholders voting for the plan, it gives them about $92.8 million in cash along with a new second-lien note for $27.5 million, for a predicted 88.8 percent recovery, according to the disclosure statement.\nUnsecured creditors are being paid in full on about $5 million in claims. The owners are making new capital contributions.\nThe notes traded on Oct. 17 for 86 cents on the dollar, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\nThe casino listed assets of $264.1 million against liabilities of $174.4 million. Debt owing to trade suppliers was estimated to be $4.3 million, according to a court filing.\nThe case is In re Circus & Eldorado Joint Venture, 12-51156, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Nevada (Reno).\nK-V Pharmaceutical\u2019s Cash Set to Increase by $6.5 Million\nK-V Pharmaceutical Co. is generating another $6.5 million in cash from the generic pharmaceutical business that was sold in June 2011.\nWhen Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. and Nesher Pharmaceuticals USA LLC bought the business, $7.5 million was placed in escrow to cover the buyers if they were sued by users of the products. The escrow was to end one year after the sale.\nThe buyers made claims against the escrow. K-V and the buyers agreed to a settlement under which $6.5 million will be released to K-V, $475,000 goes to the buyers and $500,000 remains in escrow.\nThis week, the bankruptcy court in Manhattan scheduled a Nov. 16 hearing to approve the escrow settlement.\nThe settlement will augment K-V\u2019s cash, which stood at $29.6 million at the end of September, according to a monthly operating report filed with the bankruptcy court. The company has another $9.6 million in restricted cash.\nK-V, a distributor of branded pharmaceuticals, filed for Chapter 11 protection in August. The main business is the sale of Makena, a drug reducing the risk of premature birth.\nThere will be a pivotal hearing beginning Nov. 13 with Hologic Inc. (HOLX) , which sold the Makena business to K-V in 2008 and is owed about $95 million plus royalties. Hologic has a lien on the right to distribute the product to recover the remaining payments. Hologic wants the bankruptcy judge to grant permission to foreclose rights to Makena.\nK-V, based in St. Louis , is operating with use of cash representing collateral for $225 million in senior notes. At the outset of bankruptcy, K-V had $40.1 million in cash, including $8.7 million in restricted cash, according to court papers.\nK-V listed assets of $236.6 million against debt totaling $728 million. It ceased manufacturing and distributing almost all drugs in January 2009 after the discovery that some tablets were oversized. Liabilities include $30 million on a mortgage loan.\nLiabilities include $455.6 million in long-term debt, including $225 million on the senior secured notes due in 2015. The first-lien notes traded yesterday for 45 cents on the dollar, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\nThere is $200 million owing on 2.5 percent contingent convertible subordinated notes due in 2033. The notes traded yesterday for 6.875 cents on the dollar, according to Trace.\nThe case is In re K-V Discovery Solutions Inc., 12-13346, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).\nSolar Millennium Schedules Dec. 20 Plan Confirmation\nSolar Millennium Inc. (S2M) sold two of its solar power projects and scheduled a Dec. 20 confirmation hearing for approval of the liquidating Chapter 11 plan.\nThe bankruptcy court in Delaware approved disclosure materials yesterday so creditors can begin voting on the plan.\nOpening the door to completion of the Chapter 11 case, the company sold the two projects under an arrangement that eventually may generate $110 million in value. The plan calls for paying creditors in the order of priority called for in bankruptcy law, taking settlements into consideration.\nGeneral unsecured creditors with $42.5 million in claims were told to expect a recovery between 14 percent and 20 percent.\nNextEra Energy Inc. (NEE) bought the 1,000-megawatt facility in Blythe, California , in July. On completion, it will be the world\u2019s largest solar power plant. In August, Solar Millennium sold the 500-megawatt project under development in Desert Center, California, to BrightSource Energy Inc. (BRSE) for a price that may reach about $30 million, if all contingent payments are made.\nFor the larger project, Solar Millennium initially said NextEra would pay $10 million in cash plus as much as an additional $40 million when the project is completed.\nThe company has been unable to sell the 500-megawatt project planned for Amargosa Valley, Nevada. Global Finance Corp. started a lawsuit in bankruptcy court in June contending that Solar Millennium lost its ownership interest in the project by not moving forward with development.\nSolar Millennium is a U.S. subsidiary of Germany \u2019s Solar Millennium AG. The Oakland, California-based company filed under Chapter 11 in April when rent was coming due the 7,000-acre Blythe project.\nThe company\u2019s solar-power projects were all in the development stage and generated no income. There was only $200,000 in secured debt at the outset.\nFinancing had been provided by the German parent and Ferrostaal AG, the owner of a 30 percent interest in the joint venture developing the U.S. projects. Ferrostaal provided no financing for two years and the German parent suspended financing in late 2011 after initiating its own insolvency proceedings in Germany.\nThe case is In re Solar Trust of America LLC, 12-11136, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).\nTrident Microsystems Has Dec. 13 Confirmation Hearing\nApproval of the Trident Microsystems Inc. (TRIDQ) reorganization plan will be the topic for a Dec. 13 confirmation hearing. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware approved the explanatory disclosure statement on Oct. 22.\nSupport for the plan by the two official committees was made possible by a settlement. One committee represents creditors and the other is for shareholders.\nAfter filing for Chapter 11 protection in January, Trident sold the businesses and generated $90 million, leaving $71 million at the end of June, according to the disclosure statement.\nBefore a settlement, the largest impediment to distribution was disagreement over the $73.2 million claim that Trident has against affiliate Trident Microsystems ( Far East ) Ltd., which is now represented by liquidators appointed by a court in the Cayman Islands.\nThe settlement provides for the liquidators to receive as much as $14.9 million in cash, allowing unsecured creditors of TMFE to have a recovery of 55 percent to 81 percent on $96.4 million in claims.\nOther unsecured creditors with claims against TMFE will be paid 90 percent on claims of $16.6 million.\nUnsecured creditors with claims of about $3 million against Trident will be paid in full, allowing a distribution of as much as 28 cents a share for stockholders.\nAnnouncement of the settlement caused a 35 percent decline in Trident\u2019s stock. It closed yesterday at 25 cents, unchanged in over-the-counter trading.\nTrident\u2019s television business was sold for about $22.5 million in cash to Sigma Designs Inc. (SIGM) Entropic Communications Inc. (ENTR) purchased the set-top box business for $65 million.\nBefore filing under Chapter 11 in January, Sunnyvale, California-based Trident was developing multimedia semiconductor products for the digital home entertainment market. The company and creditors together decided on selling the assets.\nThe petition listed assets of $310 million and debt of $39.6 million. The consolidated balance sheet contained in a regulatory filing listed assets of $236.8 million and total liabilities of $112.8 million as of Sept. 30.\nFor the nine months ended Sept. 30, revenue was $238 million, resulting in a $113.2 million operating loss and a $106.1 million net loss.\nThe case is In re Trident Microsystems Inc., 12-10069, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).\nDigital Domain\u2019s Post-Sale Bonuses Approved by Court\nDigital Domain Media Group Inc. (DDMGQ) received court sanction for a $350,000 incentive bonus program when the U.S. bankruptcy judge in Delaware signed an approval order on Oct. 22.\nThe company modified the program in response to objections from the U.S. Trustee and representatives of former workers who weren\u2019t given requisite notification before mass firings.\nThe changes aren\u2019t public information because they were filed under seal.\nThe company originally sought authorization to pay bonuses so long as the business was sold for a price that was no less than the amount contained in a contract signed before the Chapter 11 filing on Sept. 11. The sale was approved by the judge on Sept. 25 and completed two days later.\nThe main part of the business was bought by a joint venture between Galloping Horse America LLC, an affiliate of Beijing Galloping Horse Co., and an affiliate of Reliance Capital Ltd. (RCAPT) , based in Mumbai .\nThe opening bid at auction on Sept. 21 was $15 million. The eventual price was $36.7 million, including $3.6 million to cure defaults on contracts and $2.9 million to reimburse payroll costs.\nDigital Domain listed assets of $205 million and liabilities totaling $214 million.

In 2011, there was a $75.1 million operating loss on total revenue of $98.6 million.\nThe case is In re Digital Domain Media Group Inc., 12-12568, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).\nSaab\u2019s U.S. Affiliate Has November Disclosure Hearing\nSaab Cars North America Inc., the U.S. unit of bankrupt Swedish automaker Saab Automobile AB, filed a disclosure statement telling unsecured creditors with $77 million in claims why they might receive from 7 percent to 58.5 percent from the bankruptcy begun in January.\nThe disclosure statement explains the liquidating Chapter 11 plan filed last week. A Nov. 16 hearing is scheduled for approval of disclosure materials.\nCreditors are told their eventual recovery depends on success in either knocking out, reducing or subordinating the parent\u2019s claims, which total about $50 million.\nA Sept. 30 balance sheet among the disclosure material shows the U.S. company as having $26.5 million cash.\nThe Swedish parent set up a new subsidiary to take over the distribution of parts in the U.S. The parent filed for bankruptcy in Sweden in December after running out of cash.

The lender will also convert 366.7 million reais ($181 million) of Marfrig local bonds into shares as part of the offering, according to a Oct. 24 filing. Without the additional purchase, the BNDES stake in Marfrig would drop to about 12 percent.\nMarfrig\u2019s debt tripled in the past two years to a record 9.3 billion reais at the end of the third quarter after the company made 20 acquisitions since 2007. The company, which follows meatpacker Minerva SA in selling shares to cut debt, said this week it plans to raise about 1.1 billion reais in an offering.\nBNDES, whose equity investment in Marfrig has lost 45 percent since 2007, bought 2.5 billion reais of convertible bonds to help Marfrig acquire a McDonald\u2019s Corp. supplier in 2010.

Marfrig this week reported net income of 10.4 million reais, compared with a loss of 54 million reais expected by analysts, after losses stemming from a currency drop weren\u2019t repeated.\nA BNDES official in Rio de Janeiro declined to comment.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Lucia Kassai in Sao Paulo at lkassai@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IBOV", "embersId": "e07ac2b2bbe4af8099692ea060fad310d7011d66"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-25 12:14:12", "postDate": "2012-10-25", "author": "Namitha Jagadeesh", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-25/european-stock-index-futures-rise-on-company-earnings.html", "title": "European Stocks Rise as Unilever, Sanofi Beat Estimates", "updateTime": "2012-10-25 20:48:35", "content": "European Stocks Rise as Unilever, Sanofi Beat Estimates\nBy Namitha Jagadeesh - 2012-10-25T16:14:12Z\nEuropean stocks climbed for a second day as companies including Unilever and Sanofi (SAN) posted results that exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates.\nUnilever gained 2.6 percent, its biggest advance in almost three months, after quarterly sales grew faster than analysts had projected. Sanofi rose 1.4 percent after France \u2019s largest drugmaker reported third-quarter profit that retreated less than analysts had predicted. Daimler AG (DAI) slid 2.7 percent after the world\u2019s third-largest luxury carmaker abandoned its profit- margin target for 2013.\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 Index increased 0.3 percent to 270.23 at the close in London as a report showed the U.K. moved out of recession in the third quarter. The gauge has still declined 1.4 percent so far this week as company earnings missed estimates. The equity benchmark has risen 16 percent from a June 4 low as the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve announced open-ended bond-buying programs.\n\u201cWith Europe still in recession, expectations of earnings have been moderate, so many companies beat estimates,\u201d said Manish Singh , who helps oversee $2 billion of assets as head of investment at Crossbridge Capital in London. \u201cPerhaps investors are ready to wait for things to get better. On the U.K. gross domestic product, the initial cheer may be short lived. We won\u2019t have an Olympics every quarter and we need more confirmation to feel the U.K. is out of recession.\u201d\nEarnings Season\nThirty-four companies in the Stoxx 600 post earnings today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Of the 89 companies that have reported profit so far this season, 47 have beaten estimates, while 41 have missed them.\nThe U.K.\u2019s economy expanded in the third quarter more than predicted, rebounding from a recession. Gross domestic product climbed 1 percent from the second quarter, when it dropped 0.4 percent, the Office for National Statistics said. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had predicted a 0.6 percent increase.\nIn the U.S., a Commerce Department release showed orders for durable goods rose 9.9 percent in September. They dropped a revised 13.1 percent in August. Economists had forecast a 7.5 percent increase.\nA Labor Department report showed that jobless claims declined to 369,000 in the week ended Oct. 20, following a revised 392,000 a week earlier. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg had called for 370,000.\nNational benchmark indexes declined in 10 of the 18 western- European (SXXP) markets. The U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 was unchanged, while France\u2019s CAC 40 retreated 0.4 percent. Germany \u2019s DAX advanced 0.1 percent.\nUnilever, BASF\nUnilever gained 2.6 percent to 28.45 euros, its largest rally since July, after the world\u2019s second-biggest consumer- goods company said third-quarter revenue grew 5.9 percent. That beat the 5.3 percent increase estimated by analysts in a Bloomberg survey.\nSanofi climbed 1.4 percent to 67.04 euros after the company reported a 7.4 percent decline in business net income,  which excludes some costs, to 2.22 billion euros ($2.9 billion). That exceeded the 2.01 billion-euro estimate of 14 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The drugmaker also said earnings will drop this year less than it had forecast.\nDebenhams Plc (DEB) jumped 9.2 percent to 119 pence, the highest price in five years, after saying it will continue to buy back shares next year. The U.K. department-store retailer raised its target for online sales to 600 million pounds ($967 million) from 500 million pounds and said it plans to have a total of 150 franchise stores within the next five years.\nDaimler, WPP\nDaimler slipped 2.7 percent to 36.79 euros after the German carmaker lowered its 2012 forecast and said it will no longer reach its 2013 operating-margin targets because of tougher market conditions. Daimler said late yesterday that full-year Ebit will decrease 11 percent to 8 billion euros. The owner of the Mercedes-Benz brand had said it would match last year\u2019s 9 billion euros.\nWPP Plc (WPP) fell 2.3 percent to 789.5 pence after cutting its full-year sales growth target for the second time in two months. The world\u2019s largest advertising company said revenue, excluding currency fluctuations and acquisitions, will grow 2.5 percent to 3 percent, compared with a previous forecast of about 3.5 percent.\nFrance Telecom SA (FTE) slid 5.2 percent to 8.83 euros after saying it will pay a dividend of 80 cents in both 2012 and 2013. The former telecommunications monopoly made a payout of 1.40 euros in 2011.\nLogitech International SA (LOGN) plunged 16 percent to 6.92 francs, its biggest tumble in nine years, after the world\u2019s largest maker of computer mice forecast lower sales and operating profit in the second half of the current fiscal year than a year earlier.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Namitha Jagadeesh in London at njagadeesh@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Andrew Rummer at arummer@bloomberg.net\nEuropean Stocks Climb as BASF, Unilever Results Beat Estimates\nRalph Orlowski/Bloomberg\nTraders work on the floor of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in Frankfurt.\nTraders work on the floor of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in Frankfurt.

Profit at Banco Santander SA (SAN) , Spain\u2019s biggest lender, slumped in the first nine months as it took a 14.5 billion-euro charge on real estate losses.\nConfronting the toxic legacy of Spain\u2019s 10-year building boom is imposing political costs on Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy as he faces protests on the streets of Madrid, a separatist challenge in Catalonia and a battle to avoid a full bailout. His European partners are complicating the task as they blanche at putting capital on the line to backstop Spanish lenders.\n\u201cThey are dragging their feet because there are still question marks over where the money comes from to plug the gaps,\u201d said Olly Burrows, a London-based credit analyst at Rabobank International. \u201cRegardless of whether or not there is a bailout of Spain, we need to clean up the banking system.\u201d\nBonds Fall\nBanco Financiero y de Ahorros SA\u2019s 372.25 million euros of subordinated floating-rate notes due October 2016 fell by more than 7 percent overnight. The securities opened at 21 cents on the euro, compared with 22.6 yesterday, and were at 22.25 as of 1:28 p.m. in Madrid, according to Bloomberg generic prices.\nThe yield on Spain\u2019s 10-year government bond dropped two basis points to 5.55 percent, after exceeding 7.75 percent in July.\nEuropean policy makers, who are still to make the first payment of a 100 billion-euro bank rescue agreed in June, insist Rajoy can\u2019t use public money to rescue retail investors who bought preferred shares as part of publicity drives by banks.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel placed new hurdles in Rajoy\u2019s path at a European Union summit in Brussels last week when she said that any bailout loans disbursed before the bloc completes a banking union will stay on the Spanish government\u2019s balance sheet.\nRajoy Stymied\nThat ties the sovereign more tightly to its ailing banking system, dashing Rajoy\u2019s plans to transfer bailout loans to the EU rescue fund once the banking union starts. Merkel also damped expectations that the bloc will meet its deadline to bring together lenders under a single supervisor by the start of next year as AAA rated sovereigns in northern Europe backed away from a pledge made in June.\n\u201cThe problem is the decisions are not being made in Spain,\u201d Burrows added. \u201cThere\u2019s stalling on the European level.\u201d\nThe strictures the EU is imposing on Spain\u2019s banking clean- up make it harder for the government to rebuild Bankia (BKIA) , which was nationalized in June, by forcing losses on some of its best retail clients. Economy Minister Luis de Guindos has said in Parliament in Madrid that banks should never have sold preferred shares to individual investors.\nSharing Burden\nUnder EU rules, junior bondholders must share the burden of rescuing lenders to reduce the cost to taxpayers and the exercise typically involves exchanging the notes for cash or new securities at a discounted value.\nIn a fresh sign of the weakness in Spanish banks, Santander saw net income drop to 100 million euros in the third quarter from 1.8 billion euros a year earlier as it pushed on with the process of recognizing its real estate losses. The bank, which runs retail operations across Europe and the Americas, said the process of purging its balance sheet of real estate losses ordered by de Guindos is 90 percent complete.\nBanco Sabadell SA, Spain\u2019s no. 5 bank, said today that bad loans rose to 8.5 percent of its portfolio in the third quarter from 5.7 percent a year ago.\nSantander Chief Executive Officer Alfredo Saenz added his voice to those urging Rajoy to trigger ECB bond-buying by asking for financial help from the EU rescue fund.\n\u201cIt seems clear that it would reduce the risk premium for the sovereign and reduce the spreads that the most important Spanish banks pay,\u201d Saenz said on a call with analysts today.\nToxic Warehouse\nSantander\u2019s 1 billion euros of 4 percent senior bonds due 2017 trade at 318 basis points above the mid-swaps rate, a benchmark for fixed-rate debt, according to Bloomberg prices. That compares with the 250 basis-point yield spread the lender paid when it issued the notes in March.\nOfficials in Madrid are working on plans to fund a bad bank to warehouse toxic assets from lenders bailed out by the government. The EU demanded that as a condition of the bank rescue package and Rajoy, who has until the end of November to establish the bad bank, has said it won\u2019t end up costing taxpayers.\nDe Guindos, who changed legislation to limit future sales of preference shares to retail clients after Bankia\u2019s collapse, has said the government is seeking a solution for the bank\u2019s investors. EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in June that Spain could use budget revenue to compensate them.\nSpokesmen for the ECB and the Spanish Economy Ministry declined to comment yesterday. Antoine Colombani, an EU spokesman, said the terms of Bankia\u2019s restructuring are being discussed with Spanish authorities.

Santander had agreed in 2010 to pay 350 million pounds more than the branches\u2019 net asset value when the transaction was scheduled to be completed, Edinburgh-based RBS (RBS) said at the time. That valued the business at about 1.7 billion pounds.\nSince then, Santander, Spain\u2019s biggest bank, has sought ways to increase capital. It carried out an offering of as much as $4.09 billion in shares of its Mexican unit Grupo Financiero (BSMX) Santander Mexico SAB last month.\nThe Spanish bank earlier today said third-quarter profit dipped a greater-than-estimated 94 percent as it purged more soured real estate.\nSantander\u2019s acquisitions in the U.K. include Abbey National, Alliance & Leicester and parts of Bradford & Bingley Plc. It now has about 1,200 branches and is the second-largest mortgage lender behind Lloyds Banking Group Plc.

The goal that helped his Santos team win the 2011 South American club championship wowed five executives from Japanese video game company Konami Corp. (9766) , who were in the stands.\n\u201cThe way that the crowd was reacting and the next couple days all the media talking about how great Neymar was, he reminded us of Messi when he was a lot younger,\u201d said Erik Bladinieres, Konami\u2019s director for Latin America , referring to FC Barcelona \u2019s Lionel Messi , the three-time top world player of the year. \u201cThat\u2019s when we decided we wanted to have him.\u201d\nKonami struck a deal to putNeymar da Silva Santos Jr. and his signature Mohawk on the cover of its Pro Evolution Soccer game throughout the region, joining a parade of multinationals including Nike Inc. (NKE) , Volkswagen AG (VOW) and Unilever NV (UNA) that have signed the 20-year-old star. Eike Batista , Brazil\u2019s richest man, recruited Neymar for his venture with IMG Worldwide Inc. that will steer his career in Brazil and beyond.\nIt\u2019s the beyond part that could prove tricky. While Neymar is the top-paid player in Brazil -- the host country of the 2014 World Cup -- he\u2019s yet to prove himself against the world\u2019s top talent, so a premature move to Europe could jeopardize his money machine, said Stephen Greyser, a Harvard Business School marketing professor specializing in sports business.\nNeymar has already had a taste of the perils involved. He failed to score in the 2012 Olympics semifinals and final, which Brazil lost to underdog Mexico. In the Tokyo final of the 2011 Club World Cup , Neymar\u2019s team went scoreless, while Messi had two goals in Barcelona\u2019s 4-0 win.\n\u201cWhy would he want to risk going to Europe now and potentially demystifying the mystique?\u201d Greyser said in an interview last month in Boston.\nPele\u2019s Footsteps\nNeymar was born in Mogi das Cruzes, a factory city outside Sao Paulo , with soccer in his veins. His father, a former lower- division player, worked several jobs simultaneously while teaching his son the game. He enrolled in the academy at Santos, making his debut for the club made famous by Pele, one of his role models, at the age of 17. On Oct. 17, he played his 200th game for the club, scoring his 119th career goal.\nHe is well-positioned in Brazil, which for the second straight year topped consulting firm A.T. Kearney\u2019s ranking of the hottest emerging retail markets. Last season he made an estimated 13.8 million euros ($18 million) a year in salary and endorsements, according to France Football magazine, making him the 13th best-paid soccer player in the world. The 25-year-old Messi tops the list at 33 million euros, yet London-based SportsPro magazine picked Neymar as the world\u2019s most marketable athlete in 2012.\nSpurning Europe\nLast month, the London-based newspaper The Sun said Manchester United (MANU) of the English Premier League was the latest top European club to make an offer for Neymar, at 38 million pounds ($60 million). Santos denied the report, and Neymar said it\u2019s too early for him to follow the path of almost every Brazilian star and transfer to a European club.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go to Europe, dude?\u201d a friend asks the shirtless Neymar on a beach in an ad that ran this year for Guarana Antarctica, a soft drink made by Cia. de Bebidas das Americas. It then cuts to Neymar in thick winter wear struggling to perform his fancy footwork in a snowstorm and losing the ball. Then back to the beach, where a grinning Neymar responds \u201cNot now\u201d before boogieing with bikini-clad Brazilians.\nOverexposure\nNeymar\u2019s managers point out that Europe is suffering an economic crisis that could hurt his immediate earning prospects. Brazil in contrast has overtaken Italy and the U.K. to become the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy. While growth has slowed since 2010, when gross domestic product expanded by 7.5 percent, the economy is picking up again and analysts surveyed by the central bank expect a 4 percent expansion next year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult economic moment in Europe,\u201d said Alan Adler , chief executive officer for IMX Talent, Batista\u2019s joint venture with New York-based IMG. \u201cBrazil is still growing, strongly or not.\u201d\nIn Brazil, where his image pops up on billboards, subway posters and magazine ads as well as TV, Neymar faces a different risk: overexposure.\n\u201cNeymar today is oversold\u201d in his homeland, Adler said in an interview in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cWe have to wait for some contracts to end to be able to start looking for new partnerships, more planned partnerships that add value.\u201d\nWhile sponsorships were a factor, the main driver behind his decision to stay at Santos was his contract that goes through the World Cup, Eduardo Musa, the player\u2019s career manager at the club, said in a telephone interview.\nMusa dismissed concerns Neymar\u2019s brand was oversold, adding that new endorsement contracts are always possible and the player hasn\u2019t received any interesting proposals.\nHomegrown Hero\nA strong performance as the homegrown hero in the World Cup \u201chas the potential to promote him to a much larger stage,\u201d Don Garber, commissioner of Major League Soccer , the main professional division in the U.S., said in a Sept. 6 interview at Bloomberg\u2019s Sports Business Summit in New York. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to rush it. When he\u2019s ready, when the market\u2019s ready to adopt him as one of the next world greats, he\u2019ll make a move.\u201d\nNeymar wasn\u2019t available to be interviewed due to game schedules, according to an official who handles media inquiries for him at Santos and who declined to be identified in line with the club\u2019s policy.\nNeymar\u2019s 143-pound (65-kilogram) frame is slight for a star striker. That didn\u2019t stop Araraquara, Brazil-based Lupo SA from featuring him in underwear ads. His physique is an asset for marketers seeking to lure young consumers with a figure they can look up to, said Jefferson Slack, senior vice president for global football at IMG. While Neymar recently changed his hairstyle, young men all over Brazil still sport Mohawks imitating his famous cut.\n\u2018Kids Relate\u2019\n\u201cHe\u2019s got everything that you want: He\u2019s a scorer, he\u2019s exciting, kids relate to him,\u201d Slack, who is also a former CEO of the Italian soccer club Inter Milan , said by telephone from London. \u201cWhy was Michael Jordan so marketable? Because kids wanted to fly and Michael said he could fly, and he was not big for a basketball player.\u201d\nNeymar also provides a runway for companies trying to reach Brazil\u2019s booming consumer market, said Kenneth Shropshire, faculty director at the University of Pennsylvania \u2019s Wharton Sports Business Initiative.\n\u201cWhat he brings with him is not just an 18-to-35 male kind of demographic,\u201d Shropshire said by phone from Philadelphia. \u201cHe brings Brazil with him; that\u2019s where you see the value\u201d to multinational retailers.\nTwitter Followers\nAmong those seeking to benefit from his golden touch is America Movil (AMXL) SAB, the mobile phone operator owned by Carlos Slim , the world\u2019s richest man. On Sept. 13, Neymar wrote to his more than 5 million Twitter followers, \u201cNow I know a ton about 4G,\u201d linking his endorsement to a website run by America Movil\u2019s local unit, Claro SA.\nNeymar also lends his name to smaller sponsors, hawking everything from dandruff shampoo to car batteries .

(WFC) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) are meant for people who can\u2019t access other forms of bank credit, similar to the clients of storefront or online payday lenders.\nScrutiny of the loans increased on Sept. 21, when North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper asked Regions Financial Corp. (RF) to provide data showing its loans don\u2019t violate the state\u2019s interest-rate cap. That followed a decision in May by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to investigate payday-like products offered by banks, joining an inquiry by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\u201cThey lend money at a high interest rate and get it paid back at the next paycheck,\u201d Cooper said in an interview. \u201cWe want to come at this from all angles to prevent these kinds of loans in North Carolina.\u201d\nThe matter also has found its way into the judicial system. In August, a private lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Ohio , claiming that Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) deceived customers about the true costs of its short-term loans.\nTraditional storefront payday loans are secured by a check, post-dated to a borrower\u2019s next payday. Online versions require clients to have payments directly debited from their bank account. Consumer groups have charged that the loans prey on low-income people by concealing costs and ensnaring them in an expensive debt cycle.\nHigh APR\nThe consumer bureau has said traditional payday loans can carry annual interest rates as high as 521 percent. The cost of the loans is usually expressed by converting the fees into an annual percentage rate. For example, a two-week $100 loan carrying a $15 fee would have a 390 percent APR.\nAt least five banks are offering the loans, typically through a customer\u2019s online account. The banks don\u2019t use the term \u201cpayday.\u201d The Regions loan is called Ready Advance while Wells Fargo markets Direct Deposit Advance. Banks say they offer lower interest rates than traditional payday loans and that, unlike nonbank lenders, they make sure customers can\u2019t renew their borrowing indefinitely.\nCustomers at Regions have given \u201coverwhelmingly positive feedback\u201d to the short-term loans, Jeffrey Lee, the bank\u2019s executive vice president, wrote in an Oct. 4 letter to North Carolina officials.\nLee said the loans \u201ccreate a credit record that will enable them to graduate to more mainstream credit products, whether with us or with another reputable institution.\u201d\nMonths in Debt\nBank products have similarities to typical payday loans, according to a study by the Durham, North Carolina-based Center for Responsible Lending. The group, which said it analyzed how 55 customers used the loans, concluded that they paid an average annual interest rate of 365 percent, took out an average of 16 loans annually and spent more than half the year in debt.\n\u201cThese loans are structured just like loans from payday shops, where borrowers typically are stuck in multiple payday loans per year -- usually in quick succession with a new fee each time, because they cannot afford to repay the loan in full, plus the fee, and meet ongoing expenses,\u201d the group wrote in the report .\nThe cost of the loans is \u201cparticularly unwarranted\u201d because the bank\u2019s ability to withdraw from the customer\u2019s next direct deposit means the risk of nonpayment is low, according to the lawsuit against Fifth Third filed Aug. 3 by customers William Klopfenstein of Royal Oak, Michigan , and Adam McKinney of Lanesville, Indiana .\nSwipe Fees\nFifth Third\u2019s payday-like product violates state interest- rate caps and the federal Truth in Lending Act, the suit alleges. Fifth Third spokeswoman Debra Decourcy declined to comment on pending litigation.\nBanks, which don\u2019t separate out their earnings from short- term loans when reporting results, are seeking ways to replace revenue lost to regulations such as tougher enrollment criteria for overdraft programs and a 2010 Federal Reserve rule limiting debit-card swipe fees. They are paying increased attention to short-term loans, according to Fiserv Inc. (FISV) , a Brookfield, Wisconsin-based firm that sells a software package to help banks market and manage the products.\n\u201cBanks can serve a different kind of consumer that they typically wouldn\u2019t serve, in a far more cost-effective way,\u201d Jeffery Yabuki, Fiserv\u2019s chief executive, said in a July 30 conference call with analysts.\nOverdraft Probe\nFiserv said its Relationship Advance software suite is aimed at helping banks identify which customers might be receptive to short-term loans. The firm says in marketing materials that the product would cause at most a small drop in a bank\u2019s revenue from checking-account overdraft fees. Overdraft fees accounted for $31.6 billion in 2011 revenue for U.S. banks, said Lake Bluff, Illinois-based Moebs Services, a research firm.\nThe flow of revenue from those fees may shrink as the consumer bureau investigates whether banks are marketing overdraft-protection programs in a misleading way.\nMichael Calhoun, president of the Center for Responsible Lending, said he met this month with Brenda Potter, Fiserv\u2019s vice president of public affairs, urging the company to abandon its payday product. Potter declined, she said in an interview.\nPotter said the company sees \u201cgreat potential\u201d among all types of banks and credit unions . Fiserv doesn\u2019t disclose the number of clients who use the software, she said.\nFlat Rate\nThe software appears as a button on online bank accounts. When clicked, it takes the user through an enrollment process. It is a \u201cvanilla system,\u201d in which the bank controls all the essential characteristics of the loan, such as maximum size, maturity and fees, Potter said.\nWells Fargo limits its Direct Deposit Advance loan to $500, and charges $7.50 per $100 borrowed. Customers may access as many as six consecutive loans. If borrowers fail to bring their account into the black after those six loans, no further cash advances are permitted until the debt is paid in full.\nSan Francisco-based Wells doesn\u2019t offer the product in 14 states, many of which ban payday lending.\nU.S. Bank , the banking brand of Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, markets Checking Account Advance, a loan of up to $500 for as long as 35 days, according to its website. The fee is $2 per $20 borrowed. Tulsa, Oklahoma-based BOK Financial Corp. (BOKF) , parent of the Bank of Oklahoma , offers a similar product called FastLoan.\nThe Regions loan is available to customers who have been with the bank at least a year. It includes a \u201ccooling off period\u201d if borrowers max out their credit line for six consecutive months, Evelyn Mitchell , a spokeswoman for the Birmingham, Alabama-based bank said.\nSimilar Customers\nThe banks may be drawing the same kinds of customers who use traditional payday lenders. Regions has calculated that about 50 percent of its customers who use Ready Advance earn over $50,000 per year, and 24 percent earn over $75,000, according to Lee\u2019s letter.\nAdvance America Cash Advance Centers, Inc., a chain of storefront payday lenders that was acquired by Grupo Elektra SAB (ELEKTRA*) this year, has a similar customer base with a median income of about $54,000 and 20 percent of customers making over $75,000, according to Jamie Fulmer, a senior vice president at the company. The median income has risen from the \u201clow 40s\u201d in the last few years, Fulmer said.\n\u201cSo many of our customers chose our products and services instead of those offered by their banks. In many cases this is because a loan from Advance America may be less expensive, in addition to being simple, transparent and fully disclosed,\u201d Fulmer said in an e-mail.\nBorrowing $150\nKaren Buschke of Birmingham said she saw an advertisement for Ready Advance loans on the Regions website and decided it was similar to short-term loans she\u2019d previously gotten for emergency car repairs or to pay a medical bill.\n\u201cI looked at it and thought, \u2018This is just like a payday loan,\u2019 \u201d Buschke, 53, said in an interview.\nShe borrowed $150. The bank deducted the repayment from her weekly paycheck a few days later. That started a cycle in which she borrowed additional money to meet her other obligations.\nBuschke complained to the bank that she hadn\u2019t had enough time to repay the loan. Her balance then was converted into an installment loan, which was finally paid off early this month. The bank has since put her in the cooling-off period, she said.\nShay Farley, legal director for Alabama Appleseed, a Montgomery-based advocacy group, said she disagreed with consumer advocates who are \u201chammering\u201d Regions over its marketing of the product.\nExecutives at the bank have met with her group twice, and have shown they\u2019re serious about consumer protection by changing the product\u2019s structure over time, she said.\n\u201cI think they are trying to do the right thing -- to find a product that meets the customers\u2019 needs and makes a profit,\u201d Farley said in an interview. \u201cIt may be an answer, even if it\u2019s not the perfect answer.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Carter Dougherty in Washington at cdougherty6@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Maura Reynolds at mreynolds34@bloomberg.net\nScrutiny of the loans increased on Sept. 21, when North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper asked Regions Financial Corp. to provide data showing its loans don\u2019t violate the state\u2019s interest-rate cap.

Ltd. (CTC/A) , the country\u2019s largest auto-parts and sporting-goods retailer, is planning to wring savings in contract talks with store dealers as competition looms from U.S. discount chain Target Corp. (TGT)\nThe Toronto-based company is negotiating with its 489 franchisees before the current accord expires on July 1, 2014, and as Target sets to open its first stores in Canada next year. Canadian Tire, which says 50 percent of Canadians shop in its stores each month, declined to discuss details of the talks or the existing contract.\nOperating costs equaled 31 percent of Canadian Tire\u2019s sales in 2011, compared with 20 percent for Minneapolis , Minnesota- based Target and 19 percent for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal- Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , Mark Petrie, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, wrote in a note Oct. 9.\n\u201cLooking at 2011, we estimate that the gap to Wal-Mart and Target would have been roughly C$950 million in operating expenses,\u201d for Canadian Tire, according to Petrie.\nEfficiency is going to be a bigger and bigger topic for the Canadian retailer, which sells auto parts, small appliances, hardware and sporting goods, Petrie said in a telephone interview from Toronto.\n\u201cCanadian Tire has significant opportunities in terms of improving its operating efficiency,\u201d and a renegotiated dealer contract is among them, Petrie said.\nTarget\u2019s northern expansion will reduce Canadian Tire\u2019s sales by 1 percent as its faces increased competition in housewares, apparel and seasonal merchandise, Jim Durran, a Barclays Plc analyst wrote in an Oct. 1 note.\nSupply Chain\nCanadian Tire, which has 1,700 retail and gasoline outlets across the country, disagrees with Petrie\u2019s estimate, said Chief Financial Officer Dean McCann. Canadian Tire\u2019s operating costs are not comparable to Target and Wal-Mart because the latter two include grocery segments and are U.S. companies, he said. Against comparable Canadian rivals, McCann said he\u2019s \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with Canadian Tire\u2019s performance.\nNegotiations with dealers on supply chain and administration could result in savings, McCann said. Those \u201care things, as a team -- between the corporation and the dealers -- we can work together to reduce costs,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.\nCanadian Tire acts as a wholesaler to dealers, who order products they think will sell best. Stores at Wal-Mart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, and Target are controlled by the corporation.\nDealer Input\nThe structure means Canadian Tire consults with dealer committees for major decisions, making it harder to remove underperforming dealers, and provides an incentive for dealers to order a surplus of sale merchandise and sell the extra at regular price after the sale ends. That increases margins at the company\u2019s expense, Petrie said in his note.\nIf the dealers allowed the company to streamline its supply-chain by giving up some control, Canadian Tire could reduce costs, Petrie wrote.\nMcCann said Canadian Tire won\u2019t reduce dealer autonomy because it\u2019s an advantage having an independent entrepreneur with knowledge of the local market making decisions for each store.\n\u201cAny perceived inefficiency is far outweighed by the opportunities, and the proof is in the pudding, we\u2019re still here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been extraordinarily effective.\u201d\nCanadian Tire will look for cost savings in the new contract, McCann said. There are already mechanisms for removing underperforming dealers, he said.\nRon Baugh, executive director of the Canadian Tire Dealers\u2019 Association, referred questions on the negotiations to the company.\nCost Savings\nThe last negotiation in 2007 produced as much as $20 million in extra pretax income that the company projected will grow to as much as C$100 million by 2014, according to a Canadian Tire statement at the time. The company didn\u2019t disclose the source of the extra income.\n\u201cOne of the advantages of Canadian Tire has been the very strong dealer organization in that the dealers have a proprietary interest in their store,\u201d said Stephen Jarislowsky, chief executive officer of Jarislowsky Fraser Ltd., the largest owner of Canadian Tire\u2019s non-voting Class A shares. \u201cYou can\u2019t piss off your dealers but you also have to be on top of the pricing.\u201d\nCanadian Tire had average revenue growth of 20 percent in the last four quarters and reported about C$3 billion in revenue in the second quarter, for a profit of C$134 million, or C$1.63 a share. Annual revenue growth at Canadian Tire will slow to 1.5 percent in 2013 after Target\u2019s arrival, compared with projected growth of 9.9 percent this year, according to a survey of analysts by Bloomberg News.\nStock Performance\nCanadian Tire rose 1.5 percent to C$71.56 at 4:20 p.m. today in Toronto. The shares have gained 8.6 percent this year through yesterday, lagging the 13 percent rise in the Standard & Poor\u2019s/TSX Consumer Discretionary Index. Three-month implied volatility, a measure of expected volatility in the stock over the next three months, has risen to about 19 percent from a low of 15 percent on Aug. 24.\nAbout 60 percent of Canadian Tire\u2019s voting shares are controlled by Martha Billes, daughter of A.J. Billes, who founded the company with his brother in 1922 in Toronto, and her son Owen, the company said in its March 15 proxy circular .\nCanadian Tire Corporation Dealer Holdings Ltd., a unit separate from the company which manages dealers\u2019 shares, owns 20.5 percent of the voting stock, the circular said.\nStore Expansion\nBoth Target and Wal-Mart are eroding the advantages of the dealer system as they use more precise market research to build knowledge of individual stores, and adjust pricing accordingly, said Alex Arifuzzaman, a partner at Toronto-based retail consulting firm InterStratics Consultants Inc. and a former financial analyst at Canadian Tire.\nWhen Wal-Mart first entered Canada in 1994, Canadian Tire maintained revenue growth by adding stores, boosting total retail square footage to 30 million by June of this year from 7.1 million, Canadian Tire said. That avenue won\u2019t be available this time, said Arifuzzaman.\n\u201cIn the past they were able to address the increased competition by growth, by increasing the store network, making the pie bigger for Canadian Tire,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now that is not the case, growth is not at the level it was in the past, so that\u2019s the only way they can do it, through operational cost savings.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ari Altstedter in Toronto at aaltstedter@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Scanlan at dscanlan@bloomberg.net\nCanadian Tire Squeezes Dealers as Target Waits\nBrent Lewin/Bloomberg\nA mechanic works on a vehicle at a Canadian Tire Corp. store in Toronto, Ontario.\nA mechanic works on a vehicle at a Canadian Tire Corp. store in Toronto, Ontario.

The shares of the Glenview, Illinois- based company had risen 1.1 percent this year through yesterday.\nFull-year earnings are expected to be $2.91 to $2.96 a share, Mead Johnson said in a statement today. It had earlier forecast earnings of $2.95 to $3.05. Fewer births in the U.S. this year and reduced consumption of its product contributed to the lower earnings forecast, Mead Johnson said. The company also said \u201cunfounded media reports\u201d in December linking its formula to contamination led to a market share decline that the company is still recovering from.\nLast year retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) pulled Mead Johnson\u2019s Enfamil nutrition formula from shelves after regulators said a Missouri infant who had been infected with the bacterium Cronobacter and died had used the product. Regulators later said they didn\u2019t find any evidence of contamination occurring during manufacturing or shipping of the formula.\nEditors: Reg Gale, Bruce Rule\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ryan Flinn in San Francisco at rflinn@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Reg Gale at rgale5@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "MEXBOL", "embersId": "9615c075885d89f7c8924c8caa516507a9803128"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-25 11:17:26", "postDate": "2012-10-25", "author": "Christie Smythe", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-24/visa-mastercard-judge-says-deal-appears-to-meet-standard.html", "title": "Visa, MasterCard Judge Says Deal Appears to Meet Standard", "updateTime": "2012-10-25 20:45:42", "content": "Visa, MasterCard Judge Says Deal Appears to Meet Standard\nBy Christie Smythe - 2012-10-25T15:17:26Z\nThe proposed settlement of a merchants\u2019 lawsuit over credit card fees that may cost Visa Inc. (V) , MasterCard Inc. (MA) and banks as much as $7.25 billion is probably worthy of initial approval, a federal judge said.\n\u201cI have reviewed the settlement agreement, and at first blush it appears to satisfy the requirements for preliminary approval,\u201d U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn , New York, said in an order yesterday.\nThe order, containing Gleeson\u2019s first public comments on the deal since it was unveiled in July, came in response to objections lodged by an expanding group of retailers and trade groups who contend it\u2019s unfair.\nGleeson said he will hear arguments against preliminary approval of the settlement on Nov. 9. He declined a request to form a committee for objecting retailers and said there would be an opportunity for a more thorough discussion at a later hearing on final approval.\nThe deal, intended to cover about 7 million retailers, would put an end to about seven years of litigation that has dogged Foster City , California-based Visa and Purchase, New York-based MasterCard. The suing merchants allege that banks conspired with the card companies to fix the so-called interchange fees that retailers are charged when customers pay with credit cards.\nToo Generous\nSome retailers and their trade associations oppose the deal, saying it\u2019s too generous to the card companies and grants too much leeway to raise rates in the future.\nVocal opponents of the deal include the Retail Industry Leaders Association, the National Retail Federation , the National Restaurant Association, the National Community Pharmacists Association and the National Association of Convenience Stores, as well as retailers Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and Target Corp. (TGT)\nJeffrey Shinder, a lawyer representing some of those groups, told the judge in an Oct. 23 letter that many merchants don\u2019t think the deal qualifies for initial approval \u201cbecause of its obvious and facial defects.\u201d\nGleeson said the objections will receive careful consideration.\nLower Threshhold\n\u201cI am mindful, however, that the threshold for preliminary approval of a proposed class action settlement is meaningfully lower than the threshold for final approval,\u201d he said in his order.\nThe ruling puts the settlement on course for approval sooner than expected, K. Craig Wildfang, a lead lawyer for plaintiffs, said in a phone interview. Wildfang and other attorneys in the case had forecast an initial hearing would take place in December or early 2013.\n\u201cAfter seven years of negotiation and two years of mediation, this is the best possible settlement for all involved,\u201d Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman for the Electronic Payments Coalition, a credit-and-debit-card industry trade group, said in an e-mail. \u201cIt\u2019s time to end this epic battle, and put our differences to rest.\u2019\nThe case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Christie Smythe in New York at csmythe1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Hytha at mhytha@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "MEXBOL", "embersId": "3fa7d9f7e849c008773876d0bacee4870dc2c785"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-25 00:00:01", "postDate": "2012-10-25", "author": "Michael P.

Regan and Nikolaj Gammeltoft - 2012-10-25T04:00:01Z\nWhen the world\u2019s largest company reports earnings today, there\u2019s one thing investors can count on: Apple Inc. (AAPL) \u2019s press-release comments will be the shortest they\u2019ll have to read among the biggest U.S. firms.\nThe CHART OF THE DAY shows that Apple\u2019s earnings releases have averaged about 250 words of commentary over the past 10 quarters, compared with an average of more than 1,300 among the rest of the 10 biggest companies by market value that regularly provide remarks in their releases.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Shakespearean phrase, `brevity is the soul of wit,\u2019 and I guess the question is whether brevity is the soul of profitability as well,\u201d Nicholas Colas, the New York-based chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group, said in a phone interview yesterday, referring to remarks by Polonius in \u201cHamlet.\u201d \u201cApple is known for being very spare in their design and the sparseness carries over to everything else too.\u201d\nApple has grown to become the largest company by market value, worth more than $575 billion as of yesterday\u2019s close, through growing sales of its iPhone and iPad devices. Analysts forecast the Cupertino, California-based company will report fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $8.3 billion on sales of $35.7 billion after the close of trading today.\nAT&T Inc. (T) , the first carrier for the iPhone, had the longest average commentary at about 1,900 words, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) , Google Inc. (GOOG) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) were next with more than 1,500 words each. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) was the closest to its rival in brevity, averaging less than 500. The word counts excluded tables, footnotes, conference-call announcements and boilerplate disclaimers about forward-looking statements and business risks.\nWarren Buffett \u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) was not included in the list because the holding company does not always issue an earnings press release. When it does issue a release, Buffett\u2019s firm usually doesn\u2019t include commentary and instead tells investors to read its quarterly reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which contain lengthy discussions of its businesses.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Michael P.

(WMT) , the world\u2019s largest retailer, combined its compliance office with ethics, investigations and legal functions to form one organization amid a bribery probe at the company\u2019s Mexico operations.\nThe new unit will report to the company\u2019s general counsel, Wal-Mart said today in a memo. The retailer also hired Jay Jorgensen, an attorney with Sidley Austin LLP in Washington , as global chief compliance officer. The moves come after Wal-Mart named Daniel Trujillo to the new position of senior vice president and chief compliance officer of its international operations earlier this month.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating allegations that Wal-Mart systematically bribed Mexican officials so it could more quickly open stores, possibly violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nWal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas , was little changed at $74.82 at the close in New York. The shares have gained 25 percent this year.\nJorgensen previously served as a law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist and Samuel Alito while he was at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, according to the memo. Wal-Mart declined to make Jorgensen available for an interview.\nThe company has spent more than $30 million over the past 17 months to implement its new global anti-corruption compliance program, according to the memo. As part of the effort, company \u201cEthics Officers\u201d outside the U.S. now must report to Wal-Mart International rather than to the CEOs in their respective countries, the memo said.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported the changes and hiring earlier.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Matt Townsend in New York at mtownsend9@bloomberg.net ; Renee Dudley in New York at rdudley6@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Robin Ajello at rajello@bloomberg.net\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "MEXBOL", "embersId": "9804c979e31e449495b350a3e09ca4840d047a77"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-24 11:46:51", "postDate": "2012-10-24", "author": "Robert Br, , Jaco Visser", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-24/pick-n-pay-mulls-african-growth-as-share-of-home-market-shrinks.html", "title": "Pick n Pay Mulls African Growth as Share of Home Market Shrinks", "updateTime": "2012-10-25 20:45:46", "content": "Pick n Pay Mulls African Growth as Share of Home Market Shrinks\nBy Robert Brand and Jaco Visser - 2012-10-24T15:46:51Z\nPick n Pay Stores Ltd. , South Africa\u2019s second-largest grocer, is investigating opportunities to expand in other African countries as profit and market share decline at home.\nThe Cape Town-based retailer may move into Nigeria, Angola and Ghana after opening stores in Zambia, Mozambique and Mauritius in its last fiscal year, Deputy Chief Executive Richard van Rensburg said in a phone interview today.\n\u201cThe time frame depends on opportunities,\u201d Van Rensburg said. \u201cOver the next 12 months we want to consolidate in the countries where we already have a presence, but we\u2019re constantly talking to developers and looking at retail space.\u201d\nPick n Pay has lost market share to competitors such as Shoprite Holdings Ltd.
