The laggards, including the U.S. and European Union, contain the majority of the world\u2019s systemic banks, it said in a report published on its website .\n\u201cThis means there is now a high probability that just six of the 29 globally systemically important banks \u201d will be covered by the so-called Basel III rules from the \u201cagreed start date,\u201d the group said in the report, submitted to the Group of 20 nations.\nGlobal regulators last year compiled the list of 29 so- called globally systemic banks, saying they should hold more capital than required by other international agreements. Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , BNP Paribas SA (BNP) , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) were provisionally earmarked to face the top level of surcharges, set at 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets.\nThose surcharges would come on top of Basel III standards, and would be phased in from 2016. Other parts of the Basel overhaul are scheduled to take effect from January and should be fully applied by 2019.\nInternational Standards\nStefan Ingves, chairman of the Basel committee, said today he\u2019s seeking swift progress toward implementation of the international standards.\n\u201cWe expect that the remaining jurisdictions will be able to finalize their rules swiftly and in a way that is true to the globally agreed minimum requirements,\u201d he said.\nThe Basel group said that \u201conly eight\u201d of its 27 members have taken all necessary steps to implement the standards, which more that triple the core capital that lenders must hold against losses. These are: Australia , China , Hong Kong , India , Japan , Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Switzerland.\nGlobal regulators have said they\u2019ll publish an updated list of systemically important banks once it\u2019s been submitted to a meeting of G-20 finance ministers next month.\nThe Basel group is also carrying out \u201con-site visits\u201d of banks as part of a probe into whether lenders are correctly assessing the risk of losses on their assets, according to the report.\nPreliminary inspections have shown \u201cmaterial unexplained\u201d differences in the losses banks expect to suffer, according to the report. Detailed findings will be reported to the committee \u201caround the end of 2012 or early 2013.\u201d\nDiplomats will discuss the EU\u2019s implementation of the Basel rules at a meeting on Oct. 31, according to the bloc\u2019s website.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jim Brunsden in Brussels at jbrunsden@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anthony Aarons at aaarons@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "CRSMBCT", "embersId": "d1cc6a104692dafd43765fc52b719272ef47abba"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-29 05:30:00", "postDate": "2012-10-29", "author": "Scott Hamilton", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-29/u-k-mortgage-approvals-climb-to-four-month-high-in-september.html", "title": "U.K. Mortgage Approvals Climb to Four-Month High in September", "updateTime": "2012-10-29 11:10:22", "content": "U.K. Mortgage Approvals Climb to Four-Month High in September\nBy Scott Hamilton - 2012-10-29T09:30:00Z\nU.K. mortgage approvals rose to a four-month high in September as the Bank of England\u2019s new credit-easing plan boosted the availability of home loans.\nLenders granted 50,024 mortgages, compared with a revised 47,921 the previous month, the Bank of England said today in London. Economists forecast that approvals would gain to 48,700 from an initially reported 47,665 in August, based on the median forecast of 18 economists in Bloomberg survey.\nWhile approvals increased, Hometrack Ltd. said today that house prices fell in October for a fourth month and a property- market recovery is unlikely without sustained economic growth. Bank of England policy makers must decide whether to inject more stimulus into the economy next week as they assess the impact of their Funding for Lending Scheme , which aims to provide banks with cheap funding.\n\u201cThe decline in house prices should be limited by recent healthy employment growth and low interest rates, while mortgages could become increasingly available helped by the FLS,\u201d Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight in London, said before the data was released. \u201cHowever, we are doubtful that the economy can grow fast enough on a sustained basis in the near term at least to really help the housing market.\u201d\nNet mortgage lending was 491 million pounds ($798 million) in September, while consumer credit was 1.2 billion pounds, the highest since February 2008, the central bank said. Credit-card lending was 307 million pounds while other personal lending was 893 million pounds, also the highest since February 2008.\nBOE Program\nThe central bank is trying to boost credit growth with its Funding for Lending program, which began in August, and a house- price survey today said property pessimism has eased. The Bank of England said on Sept. 25 that 13 banks had signed up to the FLS so far and initially may be able to borrow 61 billion pounds in total under the plan.\nBanks have curtailed lending since the financial crisis to strengthen balance sheets. The lack of credit supply has hurt Britain\u2019s housing market. Mortgage approvals are still only about half the monthly average of 103,000 in the decade to 2007 before the financial crisis struck.\nPrices declined 0.1 percent this month from September and 0.4 percent from a year earlier, London-based property research group Hometrack said in an e-mailed statement today. In a separate report, Rightmove Plc showed the proportion of people forecasting higher prices in 12 months rose to 29 percent from 22 percent a year ago.\nA measure of M4 money-supply growth the bank uses to assess the effectiveness of its asset purchases slowed to 7.4 percent in the three months through September on an annualized basis, the central bank said. That compares with a 7.9 percent gain in the three months through August. The gauge excludes financial companies that specialize in intermediating between banks, such as holding companies and non-bank credit grantors.\nTotal M4 rose 0.2 percent in September from August and was down 3.5 percent from a year earlier, the Bank of England said.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Scott Hamilton in London at shamilton8@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Craig Stirling at cstirling1@bloomberg.net\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "CRSMBCT", "embersId": "b437ff23cfc1f5953d6f65a6dc73f1c40c664be4"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-28 20:01:00", "postDate": "2012-10-28", "author": "Svenja O\u2019Donnell", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-29/u-k-october-house-prices-fall-for-fourth-month-hometrack-says.html", "title": "U.K. October House Prices Fall for Fourth Month, Hometrack Says", "updateTime": "2012-10-29 11:10:23", "content": "U.K. October House Prices Fall for Fourth Month, Hometrack Says\nBy Svenja O\u2019Donnell - 2012-10-29T00:01:00Z\nU.K. house prices fell for a fourth month in October and a property-market recovery is unlikely without sustained economic growth, Hometrack Ltd. said.\nPrices declined 0.1 percent from September and 0.4 percent from a year earlier, the London-based property research group said in an e-mailed statement today. The annual decline was the smallest in two years. Sales jumped 9.2 percent as prices of old housing stock were lowered, it said.\nWhile data on Oct. 25 showed the U.K. exited recession in the third quarter, Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said last week that the recovery is \u201cslow and uncertain.\u201d Lending growth remains subdued, with mortgage figures later today forecast to show approvals staying at less than half their pre- crisis average.\n\u201cThe foundation of any national and sustainable recovery in the housing market rests on growth in the wider economy and household incomes,\u201d Richard Donnell , Hometrack\u2019s director of research, said in the statement. Demand for homes is \u201clikely to slow down in the run-up to the year-end with agents looking to push through as many sales as possible.\u201d\nA measure of demand for homes increased 0.3 percent in October from the previous month, boosted by a 3.9 percent surge in London, the report showed.

Still, a gauge of expectations for trading prospects fell to 26 from 43, the lowest level this year.

Voting for the 450-seat Verkhovna Rada began at 8 a.m. local time and will end at 8 p.m., when the first exit polls will be published. Turnout at noon was 23.62 percent, according to Ukraine \u2019s Central Electoral Commission.\nYanukovych, 62, who has roused ethnic Russians in the regions around his native Donetsk by bolstering the status of the Russian language, trumpets stability, economic expansion and this summer\u2019s Euro 2012 soccer tournament among his party\u2019s achievements. While graft has worsened, European ties have soured and growth may reverse in the second half of the year, opponents have struggled since former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko was imprisoned in 2011.\nThe Party of Regions \u201cremains likely to secure a majority,\u201d Alex Brideau, an analyst at Eurasia Group in New York , wrote Oct. 25 in an e-mailed note. \u201cIf Regions can\u2019t get a 226-seat majority on its own, it should be able to secure an alliance with either the Communist Party or individual deputies who defect from other factions.\u201d\nBonds, Stocks\nUkraine\u2019s foreign-currency bonds have returned 24 percent this year, the most after Venezuelan debt, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) \u2019s EMBI Global Index, which gauges the yield difference relative to U.S. Treasuries.\nStill, after expanding 5.2 percent last year and 4.7 percent in 2010, the economy will contract in the second half because of lower prices for steel, Ukraine\u2019s main export earner, Erste Bank AG (EBS) and HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBA) have predicted.\nThe Ukrainian Equities Index (UX) is down 44 percent this year, more than any benchmark in the world, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The hryvnia, which has lost 1.1 percent against the dollar so far this year, rose 0.5 percent to 8.1325 on Oct. 26.\nSince coming to power in 2010, Yanukovych\u2019s relations with Ukraine\u2019s two largest neighbors have deteriorated. The government is haggling over the price of natural gas with Russia , which supplies more than half of its fuel needs. A planned Association Agreement with the European Union has been delayed indefinitely because of Tymoshenko\u2019s imprisonment for alleged abuse of office.\nInternational Standards\nHer case, which she says was engineered by the president to keep her off this week\u2019s ballot, has boosted Yanukovych\u2019s prospects.

Finra, which operates from Washington and New York, began last year disclosing daily market-level information culled from data on individual securitized-debt trades it had started collecting earlier.\nCFTC Said to Allow More Swaps Trading Via Phone in Final Rule\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission will allow more swaps to be traded over the phone than initially indicated under proposed Dodd-Frank Act reforms, according to people familiar with the matter.\nChairman Gary Gensler outlined the changes in a meeting earlier this week in New York with executives of firms that want to create regulated entities allowed to trade swaps, known as swap execution facilities, or SEFs, according to two people who attended.\nThe details of what will be allowed are still being worked out for the final draft rule, according to one of the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.\nThe change in phone trading contrasts with the proposal written in the Federal Register in January 2011, which said that \u201centities offering the following services do not comply with the statutory definition of a SEF: one-to-one voice services for the execution or trading of swaps (other than for the execution of block trades).\u201d\nTrades in interest-rate , credit-default and other types of swaps historically have been done over the phone in negotiations between banks and their customers. Gensler, with the backing of Congress through the Dodd-Frank reforms passed in 2010, has made electronic trading of the instruments a central feature of regulation in a market with $648 trillion of contracts outstanding.\nDavid Gary, a CFTC spokesman, declined to comment.\nExpanded phone trading would be a victory for inter-dealer brokers who facilitate transactions between banks. The firms, which use a combination of phone and computer trading to match buyers and sellers, lobbied the CFTC through the Wholesale Market Brokers Association, Americas to allow flexible methods of trading.\nFor more, click here.\nHertz Bid for Dollar Thrifty Said to Raise Concerns at FTC\nHertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ) \u2019s bid for antitrust clearance to buy Dollar Thrifty (DTG) Automotive Group Inc. is meeting resistance at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, according to people familiar with the situation.\nAn understanding that the deal could be approved with conditions, reached with the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition, faces opposition at the agency\u2019s Bureau of Economics, where some staffers think the $2.6 billion merger should be blocked, said the people, who declined to be identified because the matter isn\u2019t public. The two bureaus submit their recommendations to the five-member commission, which makes the final decision.\nHertz, based in Park Ridge, New Jersey , announced the acquisition on Aug. 26 and it said it expected FTC approval by mid-October. On Oct. 18, Hertz extended the deadline for the FTC to rule on the transaction to Nov. 16 from Oct. 31 because the agency needed more time to complete its review.\nHertz, which has sought to take over Dollar Thrifty for more than five years, agreed to sell its Advantage brand to address concerns that the deal would crimp competition in the rental-car market, the people said.\nFor more, click here.\nEU May Toughen Commodity Swaps Curbs in Financial Market Law\nCommodity derivative speculators may face tougher curbs under compromise plans to overhaul the European Union\u2019s financial market rules.\nGovernments may seek to restrict the number of commodity- derivative contracts that traders can enter into, according to a draft version of the rules prepared by Cyprus , which holds the rotating presidency of the EU. Such a requirement would go beyond a draft law published last year by Michel Barnier , the EU\u2019s financial services chief.\nThe position-limit rule wouldn\u2019t apply in cases where businesses are trying to use the derivatives to shield themselves from losses on investments, according to the documents. Regulators would also have some, limited power to grant other case-by-case exemptions.\nAid organizations and some governments, including France and Germany, have demanded restrictions on commodity derivatives speculation, which they blame for worldwide spikes in food prices. The Institute of International Finance , an association representing global lenders, has said there is \u201clittle convincing evidence linking financial investment with trends in commodity prices and volatility.\u201d\nBarnier\u2019s proposals, published last year, would have given regulators the chance to find alternatives to position limits.\nSpeaking to lawmakers in the European Parliament yesterday, Barnier said he backed moves to toughen the planned measures for commodity derivatives.\nTreasury, Fed Reject Call to Stop Using Libor Rates in TARP\nThe U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve defended the use of Libor in rates tied to the Troubled Asset Relief Program, rejecting a request from the watchdog of the U.S. financial crisis bailouts.\nNeither the Treasury nor the Fed has \u201cthe authority to change unilaterally the interest rate on the small number of remaining loans that rely on Libor,\u201d Timothy Massad, the Treasury\u2019s assistant secretary for financial stability, said in a letter to Christy Romero , special inspector general for TARP.\n\u201cIf we sought to renegotiate the rate, it is likely that borrowers either would not agree to a rate change or would agree only to a change that would result in a lower payment to the taxpayers,\u201d according to the Oct. 9 letter obtained by Bloomberg News .\nRomero had asked the Treasury and Fed to use other reference rates instead of Libor for Treasury\u2019s Public-Private Investment Program, or PPIP, and the Fed\u2019s Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF.\nU.S. taxpayers \u201cmay have been at risk and may continue to be at risk from the manipulation of Libor,\u201d the London interbank offered rate, Romero said in an August letter to Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner .\nBank of America Corp. (BAC) , Citigroup Inc. (C) and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc are among the banks under investigation for Libor- rate tampering. Barclays Plc (BARC) , Britain\u2019s second-biggest lender by assets, was fined $450 million in June when it became the first bank to settle with regulators over the rigging of interest rates. Chief Executive Officer Robert Diamond and Chairman Marcus Agius resigned in the aftermath.\n\u201cThe time for Treasury and the Federal Reserve to act is now, rather than wait for global Libor reform, because there are $598.6 million in outstanding TALF loans and $5.685 billion in outstanding PPIP debt with interest rates tied to Libor,\u201d the special inspector general for TARP said in a quarterly report to Congress.\nFor more, click here.\nCompliance Action\nSocGen, RBC Among Banks Said to Get N.Y. Libor Probe Subpoenas\nSociete Generale SA (GLE) , Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of America Corp. are among nine additional banks that were subpoenaed in New York and Connecticut\u2019s probe of alleged manipulation of Libor, a person familiar with the matter said.\nThe subpoenas, issued by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman starting in August, bring to 16 the total number of banks that have been subpoenaed in the states\u2019 investigation, said the person, who asked not to be identified because there wasn\u2019t authorization to speak publicly.\nSchneiderman and Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen are jointly investigating claims that banks rigged the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a worldwide benchmark for borrowing. The same person said in August that seven banks were subpoenaed in their investigation, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Barclays Plc.\nThe states are coordinating with \u201ca much larger group of attorneys general ,\u201d Susan Kinsman, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut attorney general, said in September. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi has also issued subpoenas to more than a dozen financial institutions, including UBS AG (UBS) , Deutsche Bank AG (DB) and HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)\nBesides Societe Generale , Royal Bank of Canada (RY) and Bank of America, the other six banks to receive subpoenas from New York are: Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) , Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., Norinchukin Bank, Rabobank, Lloyd\u2019s Banking Group Plc and West LB AG, a German lender that ceased operations.\nRepresentatives of those banks couldn\u2019t be reached for comment or declined to comment on the subpoenas.\nLloyd\u2019s has said it is assisting various regulators in their investigations into the setting of Libor. Royal Bank of Canada has said it is cooperating with regulators and found no evidence of collusion with other banks.\nRabobank said in a report this year that it has received subpoenas and requests for information from regulatory agencies in the U.S., Europe and Asia and is cooperating.\nMelissa Grace, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman, and Jaclyn Falkowski, a spokeswoman for Jepsen, declined to comment on the probe.\nIBM Received Request From SEC Over Dealings With Iran, ZTE\nInternational Business Machines Corp. (IBM) received a request from the Securities and Exchange Commission to describe its interactions with Iran, following reports that ZTE Corp. (000063) resold some IBM products in the country.\nIBM supplied information to the SEC, which completed its investigation in September, according to documents released yesterday. As IBM\u2019s business partner, ZTE is required to comply fully with U.S. regulations, including economic sanctions and export laws, IBM said in its response to the SEC.\n\u201cIran is designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the State Department and is subject to U.S. economic sanctions and export controls,\u201d the SEC said in an August letter to IBM. \u201cPlease describe to us the nature, duration, and extent of your past, current, and anticipated contacts with Iran, whether through subsidiaries, distributors, resellers, or other direct or indirect arrangements.\u201d\nThe SEC also requested information about IBM\u2019s contacts with Syria, Sudan and Cuba. IBM responded on Sept. 10, saying it \u201ccomplies with all U.S. economic sanctions and export laws and regulations, including those regarding countries identified as state sponsors of terrorism.\u201d In a follow-up letter to IBM on Sept. 25, the SEC said it had completed its review.\nEd Barbini , a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Margrete Ma, a spokeswoman at Shenzhen, China-based ZTE, didn\u2019t reply to an e-mail sent after business hours local time.\nEx-JPMorgan Trader Fired for Aluminum Mispricing Loses Lawsuit\nA former JPMorgan Chase & Co. commodities trader, fired for mispricing aluminum trades, lost a lawsuit against the bank when a London judge ruled he couldn\u2019t explain why the errors had all been profitable.\nDaragh Nott, who was fired in September after the bank found as many as 90 erroneous trades, sued for unfair dismissal at an employment tribunal saying he had made honest mistakes as a result of the pressure of his job.\nNott \u201cfailed to answer adequately why the large number of errors he had made on the aluminum book all favored his\u201d account, adding about $400,000 to his 2010 trading profits, according to an Oct. 17 written decision from employment judge A. Isaacson.\nInvestment banks have reduced bonuses, shed jobs and increased scrutiny of staff in the wake of losses from the 2008 financial crisis, leading to a rising number of employment disputes in London courts and tribunals.\nNott\u2019s lawyer Richard Woolmer didn\u2019t respond to an e-mail seeking comment. JPMorgan spokeswoman Kate Haywood declined to comment on the ruling.\nThe New York-based bank in March won a case in which a currency trader sought about 580,000 pounds ($935,000) over a missing decimal point in his contract. Commerzbank AG was ordered in May to pay 50 million euros ($65 million) to more than 100 Dresdner Kleinwort bankers who sued after the lender slashed bonuses.\nJPMorgan found after an internal probe that the odds of all Nott\u2019s mistakes benefiting his trading book were as much as a- trillion-to-one, Isaacson said in her judgment.\nAt a hearing in September, Nott admitted to making \u201cnumerous errors across all books due to the nature of,\u201d and pressures that went with, his job. He said his health suffered as a result of being fired and the internal company appeal process he used to try to get it back.\nCourts\nRajaratnam Appellate Judges Voice Concern Over U.S. Wiretap Bid\nJudges hearing the appeal of Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam , who is serving 11 years in prison for insider trading, voiced concern over whether prosecutors improperly won authority to wiretap his phone calls.\nA three-judge panel in Manhattan heard arguments yesterday over whether to reverse Rajaratnam\u2019s conviction for insider trading. The central issue is whether prosecutors misled the lower court judge who authorized the wiretaps in 2008 by omitting key facts from their request, and if Rajaratnam\u2019s conviction should be overturned as a result.\n\u201cWhat happens if we agree with you? Does this mean it\u2019s a new trial?\u201d U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Sack asked Rajaratnam\u2019s lawyer, Patricia Ann Millett, at the start of the argument.\nA second judge, Jose Cabranes, suggested in his questions that prosecutors acted properly. The third judge, Susan Carney, asked Millett what the \u201cremedy\u201d would be if the judges agreed that prosecutors had misled the district court.\nRajaratnam was convicted of directing the biggest hedge fund insider-trading scheme in U.S. history. At the trial, the government introduced 45 wiretap recordings, along with documents and testimony derived from the wiretaps. That evidence must be thrown out and his conviction overturned, his lawyers argued.\nKozlowski Sues New York Parole Board for Denying Release\nL. Dennis Kozlowski , the former Tyco International Ltd. (TYC) chief executive officer convicted in 2005 of looting the company, sued New York\u2019s parole board for refusing to release him.\nThe board in April denied the 65-year-old Kozlowski\u2019s request for parole in April \u201cdue to concern for the public safety and welfare.\u201d Kozlowski was sentenced to 8 1/3 to 25 years in prison in 2005 after a Manhattan jury found him guilty.\nIn a petition filed Oct. 24 in New York State Supreme Court, Kozlowski asked a judge to annul the decision and grant his application for parole or give him a new hearing, saying that the board relied on erroneous information in making its ruling.\n\u201cThe parole board denied petitioner parole using non- statutory factors, impermissibly conclusory reasoning, and incorrect information,\u201d Kozlowski said. \u201cThe board\u2019s arbitrary and capricious decision violated petitioner\u2019s due process.\u201d\nThe New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, which operates the parole board, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.\nThe case is Kozlowski v. New York State Board of Parole, 104097/2012, New York State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).\nUniversity of California Must Disclose Fund Investments Details\nThe University of California , which manages a $70 billion investment portfolio for retirees, faces a tentative court order to make \u201ca good faith effort\u201d to get and disclose the returns it earns from Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers funds.\nState court Judge Evelio Grillo in Oakland, California, said in a tentative ruling that information about the university\u2019s commitment to the funds, cash invested, current net asset values and returns for individual investment vehicles with Kleiner and Sequoia, as well as communications with the private equity firms, aren\u2019t exempt from disclosure under state laws passed in 2005.\nGrillo rejected the university regents\u2019 argument in a public records lawsuit that the information should remain secret. The 26-member board of regents governs the university.\nThe ruling came in a public records lawsuit against the university filed by Reuters America LLC, a unit of Thomson Reuters Corp. (TRI) The news agency is a competitor of Bloomberg News.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe it\u2019s appropriate to comment until he issues his final ruling after considering the arguments presented by the parties\u201d at an Oct. 19 hearing, said Dianne Klein, a spokeswoman for the University of California\u2019s office of the president, in an e-mail yesterday.\nKleiner, based in Menlo Park, California, and Sequoia aren\u2019t named as defendants in the lawsuit. Andrew Kovacs, a spokesman for Menlo Park-based Sequoia Capital Operations LLC, declined to comment on the ruling. There was no immediate response to an e-mail to Kleiner\u2019s media office.\nThe case is Reuters v. Regents, RG12-613664, Alameda County Superior Court (Oakland, California).\nSpeeches and Interviews\nEU Banks Need \u2018TARP-Like\u2019 Program, Millstein and Studzinski Say\nEuropean banks , battered by the sovereign-debt crisis and tougher regulation, need a \u201cTARP-like\u201d program to help boost market confidence and lending, Jim Millstein and John Studzinski said.\n\u201cUltimately, they need a central authority providing equity behind the banking system\u2019s liabilities,\u201d Millstein, the former U.S. Treasury Department chief restructuring officer who started the turnaround advisory firm Millstein & Co., said in a panel discussion at Bloomberg\u2019s Dealmakers Summit in New York yesterday. \u201cThe large European banks are actually more leveraged than our banks were at the beginning of the crisis.\u201d\nTARP is the Treasury Department\u2019s Troubled Asset Relief Program, a $700 billion bank-bailout fund that provided capital injections to firms including Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. during the financial crisis. European banks are struggling to fulfill a pledge made last year to cut more than $1.2 trillion of assets to help them weather the sovereign-debt crisis, stoking investor concern about financial stability.\n\u201cThe traditional model in Europe for the banking system is bust,\u201d said Studzinski, senior managing director and global head of Blackstone Advisory Partners LP, citing the dependency of companies on banks as well as the structure of large banks and local state-owned lenders. He also called for a TARP-like program for the region\u2019s banks.\n\u201cYou need some sort of pan-European deposit guarantee system\u201d to slow down the flight of capital, said billionaire investor Wilbur Ross , speaking at the same event. He called it a \u201cconceptual error\u201d to try to impose new Basel III regulations while simultaneously asking banks to lend more. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work.\u201d\nFor more, click here.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ellen Rosen in New York at erosen14@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Hytha at mhytha@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "CRSMBCT", "embersId": "b8783d621af2c2da6fe45f3a96f0fd68ca720ba9"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-26 01:01:04", "postDate": "2012-10-26", "author": "Eleni Himaras , Bei Hu", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-26/hedge-fund-boxers-bloody-noses-amid-bikini-models-in-hong-kong.html", "title": "Hedge Fund Boxers Bloodied Amid Bikini Models in Hong Kong", "updateTime": "2012-10-29 11:10:28", "content": "Hedge Fund Boxers Bloodied Amid Bikini Models in Hong Kong\nBy Eleni Himaras and Bei Hu - 2012-10-26T05:01:04Z\nPlay\nHedgies Trade Uppercuts in Hong Kong Fight Night\n\u201cIt was just so quick,\u201d said Danielle \u201cSteely\u201d Midalia after defeating Andrea \u201cGlynn- sanity\u201d Glynn in the only women\u2019s bout at last night\u2019s sixth annual Hedge Fund Fight Nite in Hong Kong.\n\u201cYou have no time to think, you just have to rely on your training and what your corner men tell you,\u201d the creative manager at The Cat Street Gallery said, red-faced and covered with sweat just minutes after the bout that had bloodied her and her rival\u2019s noses. \u201cIn some ways it was easier than training -- as they say, train hard, fight easy.\u201d\nThe pair, 12 other pugilists, and 600 guests were greeted by bikini-clad models and black-tie waiters bearing trays of beer and wine at the Indian Recreation Club in Happy Valley. Festivities opened when four women in hooded boxing robes stepped into the ring, stripped off to reveal red bikini tops and hot pants, and began a choreographed dance routine under multicolored strobe lights.\nThere were few signs of the financial industry\u2019s woes, as guests bid on high-priced trips including fishing in Mongolia between bouts and courses of fig, Iberico ham salad and roast beef. The event raised more than HK$500,000 ($64,512) for charities that fund surgery for children with facial deformities, and combat crime and juvenile delinquency in low- income and immigrant communities, falling short of the HK$1 million goal set by organizer IronMonger Events Ltd.\nThe financial industry has been taking its own punches amid shrinking equity volumes. Bank of America Corp., BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG, Macquarie Group Ltd., Morgan Stanley, Nomura Holdings Inc., and UBS AG are all shedding jobs.\n\u2018The Tank\u2019\nAnthony \u201cThe Tank\u201d Carango, 40, who attended West Point and went on to man the turret of an M1 Abrams tank, defeated Craig \u201cEl Toro\u201d Barnish in the second round of the evening. He had more to celebrate than victory: His second child was born less than two weeks earlier.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been tough the last week, trying to fit in twice a day training with a newborn,\u201d Carango, an executive director at Nomura, said after the fight, brandishing a cigar, glass of wine, gold medal and broad smile. He said his wife has been \u201chugely supportive,\u201d taking late night wake-up responsibilities the evening before the fight.\nThe 14 finalists trained at Jab Mixed Martial Arts Studio in the heart of the business district twice a week for five months. In addition to the sessions of sparring, punching bag work, crunches and rope-skipping, most trained four to five times a week, and in some cases twice a day. The finalists were culled from 70 hopefuls and were paired off for seven bouts of three two-minute rounds each.\nNo Knockouts\nAll the fights went the distance, with no knockouts. All seven bouts were decided on points by the ring-side judges.\nEach bout opened with a pre-taped video of the boxers talking about their training and opponents. At the fight\u2019s end, the referee raised the hand of the victor when the tuxedo wearing announcer proclaimed a winner.\nIn between the matchups, models in Union Jack and Stars- and-Stripes bikini tops mingled with bankers, while ski trips, art works and bottles of wine were auctioned for charity.\nThe region\u2019s hedge funds have been staging their own fightback. The Eurekahedge Asian Hedge Fund Index returned 2.3 percent in September, the best performer among five regional indexes, based on preliminary figures. The index has returned 3.9 percent this year through September compared with the 4.3 percent advance by the global industry gauge.\nGood Punch\nSteve \u201cThe Wizard of Wanchai\u201d Taw, the oldest competitor at age 53 in the history of the event, lost to Blaire \u201cThe Bear\u201d Crichton, an associate vice president in business development at HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , 26 years his junior.\n\u201cHe got in one punch that was really good,\u201d said the sweat-soaked Taw, a director at South Ocean Management Ltd., who said this will be his last round in the ring. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really hurt because you have the gloves and the padding, but all the time, it\u2019s in the back of your mind.\u201d\nTaw competed four years after his son\u2019s victory in the same charity event. Thomas Taw, 27, who works in electronic trading at Macquarie, was standing in his father\u2019s corner during the fight.\nOther fighters at the event included Barnish, co-founder of BAH Partners, Ltd., Nicolas Boulay, a derivatives broker at Louis Capital Markets ; Adam Gazal, a managing partner at National Australia Bank Ltd.; Grant Livingston, an executive director in convertible bonds at JPMorgan Chase & Co.; Brad Moreland, a director in prime services at HSBC; Mark O\u2019 Reilly, a managing director at Astbury Marsden; George Radford, a consultant at property investment company IP Global; Richard Rouse, an account manager at HSBC, and Andrew Wylde, head of sales and operations at Hatstand Consulting, who sported the night\u2019s bloodiest nose.\nStandard tables of 12 cost HK$24,000 with the ringside version pulling in HK$50,000. The event at Happy Valley wrapped up with the last bout just before midnight, when the pugilists and many of their supporters then filed into taxis to Lan Kwai Fong, the city\u2019s stretch of bars and restaurants in the business district.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Eleni Himaras in Hong Kong at ehimaras@bloomberg.net ; Bei Hu in Hong Kong at bhu5@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Hwee Ann Tan at hatan@bloomberg.net\nHedge Fund Boxers Bloodied Amid Bikini Models in Hong Kong\nAaron Tam/AFP via Getty Images\nMark O'Reilly of Astbury Marsden, left, and George Radford of IP Global fight during their boxing bout as part of the 2012 Hedge Fund Fight Nite, a promotional boxing event held by the banking and hedge fund industry, on Oct. 25, 2011 in Hong Kong.\nMark O'Reilly of Astbury Marsden, left, and George Radford of IP Global fight during their boxing bout as part of the 2012 Hedge Fund Fight Nite, a promotional boxing event held by the banking and hedge fund industry, on Oct. 25, 2011 in Hong Kong.

The focus has shifted, and it\u2019s now being a network bank, which is to link Russian corporates looking out and multinationals looking in.\u201d\nEurope \u2019s largest bank was hired this month by Russian lenders OAO Sberbank, OAO Gazprombank and Home Credit & Finance Bank to arrange $3.5 billion in debt sales. London-based HSBC has a 50 percent share of the export credit market in Russia this year by number of deals, according to the bank.\nHSBC, along with Barclays Plc and Banco Santander SA (SAN) , are among international lenders that abandoned consumer banking in Russia over the past two years as state-controlled Sberbank and VTB Group increased market share. Nomos Bank, Russia\u2019s second- biggest privately owned bank, is being acquired by Otkritie Financial Corp, part-owned by VTB.\nHSBC in March 2008 announced a $200 million capital injection into its Russian unit that \u201cdemonstrated\u201d its long- term commitment to the nation, ex-Russia CEO Stuart Lawson said then. Six months later, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed, triggering a global market rout as credit markets froze.\nThird CEO\nThe bank had four branches in Moscow and one in St. Petersburg and had been building local wealth management and ruble-bond-trading operations. Its loan book was sold to Citigroup Inc. (C) in June 2011 and the branches to Sberbank that September, according to HSBC.\nStadler was named CEO of HSBC\u2019s Russia unit in May, the bank\u2019s third local head since 2010. He succeeded Huseyin Ozkaya, who replaced Lawson. The British-born Stadler, who doesn\u2019t speak Russian, had moved to London this year from Dubai to run private banking in the U.K. and was previously global market head of HSBC Private Bank in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\u201cState banks here are formidable competitors, and we are used to that experience in other parts of the world with China and India being obvious examples,\u201d Stadler said.\nHSBC, which generates most of its profit in Asia , is planning to sell 10 billion rubles ($333 million) in its first Russian debt issue to diversify funding and to meet demand by international clients operating in Russia, Stadler said.\nIPO Pulled\nThe bank, which has more than 270 employees in Moscow and St. Petersburg , is the 10th largest organizer of foreign debt in Russia this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. HSBC was also hired by OAO Promsvyazbank to help it sell shares in an initial public offering. The IPO was postponed on Oct. 15, and HSBC is looking at alternatives for Promsvyazbank to raise capital, such as selling subordinated debt, Stadler said.\n\u201cWe have seen at first hand the clear preference by investors to take credit rather than equity risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Promsyvazbank IPO, which we were a lead on, was pulled because investor pricing requirements were not in line with the bank\u2019s view on valuation.\u201d\nHSBC is \u201clooking again\u201d at Russia \u2019s privatization program after not applying to the Kremlin to be an adviser, Stadler said. Twenty-three domestic and foreign banks were chosen to advise the government on its 1 trillion rubles of asset sales.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jason Corcoran in Moscow at jcorcoran13@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Frank Connelly at fconnelly@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "CRSMBCT", "embersId": "d99a5160a7b2ab045681df4548d16d70b7864d1c"}], "IBVC": [{"postTime": "2012-10-26 17:17:14", "postDate": "2012-10-26", "author": "Allison Bennett", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-25/yen-set-for-biggest-weekly-drop-in-2-months-on-boj-wagers.html", "title": "Yen Strengthens From Four-Month Low on Demand for Safety", "updateTime": "2012-10-29 11:11:03", "content": "Yen Strengthens From Four-Month Low on Demand for Safety\nBy Allison Bennett - 2012-10-26T21:17:14Z\nThe yen rose from a four-month low against the dollar as disappointing U.S. corporate results and record unemployment in Spain boosted the allure of the relative safety of Japan\u2019s currency.\nThe Japanese currency still had a five-day loss versus the greenback amid bets the Bank of Japan (8301) will increase monetary stimulus next week. South Africa\u2019s rand climbed. Europe \u2019s shared currency dropped after Spanish unemployment data showed a record one in four residents was out of work last quarter.\n\u201cGiven that Japan is a capital exporter, has a very large foreign asset position, if there are rising risks, even for domestic reasons, you tend to see money flowing back,\u201d said Aroop Chatterjee , a currency strategist at Barclays Plc in New York . \u201cThe yen is the move that stands out today. The chances are still fairly high that the BOJ goes in for additional easing, so I would not be fully unwinding bets on that just yet.\u201d\nJapan\u2019s currency gained 0.8 percent to 79.65 per dollar at 5 p.m. New York time after touching 80.38 earlier, the weakest since June 25. It lost 0.4 percent this week. The yen advanced 0.8 percent to 103.05 per euro and touched 102.69, the strongest since Oct. 16. It rose 0.2 percent on the week. The greenback was little changed at $1.2938 to the 17-nation currency after reaching $1.2883 earlier, the strongest level since Oct. 11. It gained 0.7 percent over the past five days.\nYield Spread\nThe yen was also supported against the dollar as U.S. Treasuries\u2019 yield advantage over Japan \u2019s government securities narrowed, making American debt less attractive to Asian investors. The yield spread between U.S. and Japanese 10-year bonds shrank to 99 basis points, or 0.99 percentage point, from 104 basis points yesterday.\nThe Japanese currency typically gains in times of political, financial and economic turmoil because the nation\u2019s historical trade surplus means the nation doesn\u2019t have to rely on overseas lenders.\nThe Bank of Japan will release a forecast for the nation\u2019s consumer prices and growth on Oct. 30, when it holds its second policy meeting this month.  The Nikkei newspaper reported yesterday the central bank may increase its asset-purchase target by 10 trillion yen ($125 billion) to 90 trillion yen.\n\u201cRecently the data has been somewhat more mixed, and the market has been concerned about corporate earnings,\u201d said Sebastien Galy , a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Societe Generale SA in New York. \u201cThe yen had been weakening because of the expectation of the expansion of the balance sheet by the BOJ relative to the Fed, which was also in line with rising expectations for the U.S. economy .\u201d\nDollar Index\nThe Dollar Index (DXY) , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S. trading partners, was little changed at 79.997 after earlier rising above its 50-day moving average of 80.155. It touched 80.270, the highest level since Sept. 11.\nThe gauge may climb to a seven-week high between 80.65 and 80.70 after rising through resistance at 80.20, Niall O\u2019Connor , a New York-based technical analyst at JPMorgan, wrote today in a note to clients. The 200-day moving average is 80.65. Resistance is an area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered.\nSouth Africa\u2019s rand climbed 1.2 percent to 8.6431 to the dollar after the U.S. economy grew more than forecast in the third quarter. America is the second-largest destination for the nation\u2019s exports.\nKiwi Gains\nNew Zealand\u2019s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, gained 0.6 percent to 82.29 U.S. cents, approaching the three-week high of 82.43 cents that it reached yesterday.\nU.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 2 percent annual pace after gaining 1.3 percent in the prior quarter, Commerce Department figures showed today in Washington . A Bloomberg survey had forecast a rise to 1.8 percent. The economy grew at a 4.1 percent pace from October through December 2011.\nThe euro has tumbled 2.1 percent this year against nine developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation- Weighted Indexes. The yen lost the most, 5.6 percent, and the dollar fell 1.9 percent. New Zealand\u2019s dollar was the biggest winner, rallying 4.5 percent.\nSpain\u2019s unemployment rate rose to 25.02 percent, from 24.6 percent in the previous quarter, the National Statistics Institute said in Madrid today. It was the highest level since at least 1976, the year after dictator Francisco Franco \u2019s death led Spain to democracy.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the euro a bit lower,\u201d said Peter Frank , a foreign-exchange strategist at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) in London . \u201cWhat\u2019s been a marginal underperformance in the growth outlook in the euro zone in the past few quarters is turning into quite a big gulf\u201d as other major economies show signs of recovery, he said.\nCrisis Outlook\nSpeculation increased that Europe\u2019s three-year-old sovereign-debt crisis may worsen after German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said there are doubts about whether Greece , where the turmoil began, has met its commitments for an international bailout.\n\u201cWe do want Greece to be able to stay in the euro zone,\u201d Schaeuble said in an e-mail release of an interview to be broadcast Oct. 30 on ZDF television. \u201cBut Greece has a lot to do. It\u2019s not decided.\u201d\nThe Canadian dollar weakened for a fourth day against the greenback, the longest losing streak since May, on concern demand for the nation\u2019s natural resources will decline as investors question global-growth prospects. Futures on crude oil, Canada\u2019s biggest export, touched $85 a barrel in New York, almost a three-month low.\nThe loonie, as the currency is nicknamed for the image of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, weakened 0.2 percent to 99.69 cents per U.S. dollar .\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index fluctuated as investors watched economic and earnings reports. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., the biggest U.S. tiremaker, reported third-quarter profit below analysts\u2019 estimates. Apple Inc. forecast earnings yesterday that fell short of analyst estimates.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Allison Bennett in New York at abennett23@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Dave Liedtka at dliedtka@bloomberg.net\nYen Set for Biggest Weekly Drop in 2 Months on BOJ Easing Bets\nKiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg\nThe yen traded at 80.21 per dollar at 9:03 a.m. in Tokyo after earlier touching 80.38, the weakest since June 25.

It\u2019ll naturally have an impact on insurance companies but other companies by putting a crimp on sales in the areas affected by the storm.\u201d\nThe U.S. securities industry canceled equity trading on all markets today, moving to protect workers, as Sandy approached New York City with wind speeds up to 85 miles (140 kilometers) per hour and the threat of an 11-foot (3 meter) sea surge.\n\u201cThere will probably be an economic impact if Sandy does hit land at hurricane force,\u201d said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, head of research at Charles Stanley Group Plc in London . \u201cIt is also probably one of the reasons why the insurance sector is under a little pressure today.\u201d\n1996 Blizzard\nThe trading shutdown, announced by the Securities and Exchange Commission, may extend through to tomorrow.

Third-quarter earnings at 72 percent of the gauge\u2019s companies that have reported so far beat estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales missed forecasts at 59 percent of companies, the data showed.\nEquity futures maintained losses today after a Commerce Department report showed consumer spending in the U.S. rose 0.8 percent in September, more than forecast, after a 0.5 percent gain the prior month. The median  estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 71 economists called for a 0.6 percent gain. Incomes rose 0.4 percent, compared with a 0.4 percent gain forecast in the Bloomberg survey.\nFiscal Cliff\nThe jobless rate probably rose in October as U.S. employers kept a tight rein on payrolls with the nation closing in on the so-called fiscal cliff, economists said before a report on Nov. 2. The fiscal cliff refers to more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts that will take effect in 2013 unless Congress can reach a budget compromise.\n\u201cI am not entirely convinced we will see the typical year- end rally,\u201d said Batstone-Carr. \u201cUntil the U.S. fiscal cliff negotiations come to some sort of conclusion, why take on the risk?\u201d\nTravelers declined 1.6 percent to $70.24 and Allstate fell 0.6 percent to $39.85 in German trading today.\nNYSE Euronext (NYX) , the operator of the New York Stock Exchange, slid 0.6 percent to $24.59 in Europe.

Sales reached 13.1 billion euros, compared with an average 2.6 billion euros in the first eight months of the year.\nThe demand meant utility Energias de Portugal SA was able to sell the nation\u2019s first benchmark-sized corporate bond offering in 20 months on Sept. 14, followed a week later by an issue from Portuguese toll road operator Brisa Concessao Rodoviaria SA.\n\u201cA lot of investors who were running underweight positions on peripheral corporates had seen the positive ECB developments and had to fight to get allocations in the primary market,\u201d said Nicolo Bocchin, a portfolio manager at Aletti Gestielle SGR SpA in Milan, who helps oversee 2 billion euros of assets.\nPrices of peripheral corporate bonds rose more than any other company debt issued since September, accounting for the top four price climbers, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nESB Finance Ltd. led gains as the Irish power company\u2019s 6.25 percent 2017 notes sold Sept. 4 climbed 11.6 percent since they were issued to 111.59 cents on the euro. Madrid-based Telefonica\u2019s 5.811 percent 2017 bonds rose 9 percent and Italy\u2019s Snam SpA (SRG) \u2019s 5 percent 2022 securities were up 8.8 percent. That compares with an average price gain of 1.1 percent for all non- financial company debt issued since August.\nBiggest Issuers\nPeripheral companies were among this year\u2019s biggest bond issuers in Europe. Rome-based Enel raised 6.3 billion euros from bonds, the third-highest after Volkswagen AG and BHP Billiton Plc, while Telefonica sold 4.5 billion euros of securities.\n\u201cI get the sense that the stronger peripheral names, such as Telefonica, already have enough liquidity to cover maturities for 2013 and 2014,\u201d said Kieran Roane, a London-based portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management Ltd., which oversees $3.1 billion.\nThe Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings rose eight basis points this week to a two-week high of 129 basis points.\nA basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10 million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Hannah Benjamin in London at hbenjamin1@bloomberg.net ; Katie Linsell in London at klinsell@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Paul Armstrong at parmstrong10@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IGBVL", "embersId": "55bf793181aac2f5310661a51336c2c928972143"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-26 07:52:26", "postDate": "2012-10-26", "author": "Ladka Bauerova", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-26/slovak-nuclear-power-plants-must-ramp-up-power-supply.html", "title": "Slovak Nuclear Power Plants Must Ramp Up Power Supply", "updateTime": "2012-10-29 11:12:09", "content": "Slovak Nuclear Power Plants Must Ramp Up Power Supply\nBy Ladka Bauerova - 2012-10-26T11:52:26Z\nStress tests at Slovakia\u2019s two nuclear power stations revealed that the facilities need to improve the safety of auxiliary electricity supply, the country\u2019s nuclear security chief said.\nPlants in Jaslovske Bohunice and Mochovce, controlled by Enel SpA (ENEL) , were forced to review and improve the diesel generators that ensure the supply of power to the power stations, especially the circuits operating the nuclear reactors, Marta Ziakova, the chairwoman of the Slovak Nuclear Safety Office, said in an interview in Valec, Czech Republic yesterday.\nThe Mochovce plant, which currently operates two Soviet- designed water-pressure reactors VVER and is building two more, had to increase the capacity of its diesel generators to be able to supply all four units with electricity at the same time, she said. Her office also asked the Jaslovske Bohunice plant to carry out a seismic safety review.\n\u201cWe asked the Bohunice management to review the plant\u2019s resistance to seismic activities, especially the resistance of the diesel generators,\u201d Ziakova said.\nThe reviews were part of Europe-wide nuclear stress tests carried out after the reactor disaster at Japan \u2019s Fukushima Dai- Ichi plant in March last year. The accident occurred when a tsunami knocked out power supply to Fukushima reactors, disrupting the cooling process that led to reactor meltdown, causing mass evacuations and leading to long-term environmental damage.\nThe post-Fukushima stress tests have delayed the completion of units 3 and 4 at Mochovce to 2014-15. So far there is no indication of further delays, Ziakova said.\nThe older Jaslovske Bohunice reactors received a 10-year life extension in 2008. Slovenske Elektrarne AS, the Slovak utility controlled by Enel, invested about 500 million euros ($645 million) into modernization and improving output. Slovenske can apply for further lifespan extension by 2014, she said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ladka Bauerova at lbauerova@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Will Kennedy at wkennedy3@bloomberg.net\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IGBVL", "embersId": "23ff4919768971904749432cb661cd28b27e0129"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-26 17:46:05", "postDate": "2012-10-26", "author": "Sean B.

Canada\u2019s banks have been ranked the world\u2019s soundest for the past five years by the World Economic Forum .\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at the Canadian banking system in the context of our concerns about the convergence of some negative trends that we see out there, some domestic and some macroeconomic trends,\u201d Beattie said in a telephone interview.\nThe ratings for Royal Bank of Canada , the country\u2019s largest lender, were affirmed. The Toronto-based bank had its credit rating cut two levels to Aa3 by Moody\u2019s on June 21 because of its \u201csignificant exposure\u201d to volatile capital markets activities.\n\u2018Well Capitalized\u2019\n\u201cTD continues to be well capitalized and remains one of the safest and strongest banks in the world,\u201d Stephen Knight , a Toronto-Dominion spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cTD continually evaluates its portfolio and conducts regular stress tests to ensure its portfolio is consistent with its conservative risk appetite.\u201d\nSpokesmen for the five other Canadian lenders didn\u2019t immediately return phone calls seeking comment.\n\u201cAll they\u2019re saying is they\u2019re just repositioning the Canadian bank ratings within their global scale,\u201d said Peter Routledge , an analyst at National Bank Financial in Toronto who was previously a senior credit officer at Moody\u2019s. \u201cIf you owned a bond issued by a Canadian bank, you would not be more afraid of losing your money as a result of this action.\u201d\nThe Moody\u2019s review, which will take about 90 days, follows a similar outlook downgrade by Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services in July.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Sean B.

Gross margins have fallen on a year-over-year basis for 11 straight quarters. Petrobras\u2019s shares plunged by the most in almost three months after the company posted an unexpected drop in net income on Oct. 26.\nThe producer, which is investing $236.5 billion as it develops the Americas\u2019 largest oil finds in more than three decades, is struggling to contain surging labor and equipment costs as inflation accelerates after Brazil \u2019s central bank cut interest rates to a record low. Petrobras has also faced delays of more than a year in getting the drilling rigs it needs to tap deposits trapped under as much as 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) of salt and rocks below the Atlantic seabed.\n\u201cAs long as Petrobras is increasing production offshore in deeper areas, of course that has associated cost increases,\u201d Ana Paula Ares, an analyst at Fitch Ratings who covers Latin American oil producers, said in a telephone interview from Buenos Aires. \u201cLifting costs at Pemex are almost half that of Petrobras, because Pemex is on shore and in shallow waters, while Petrobras is in deep waters.\u201d\nLifting Costs\nRio de Janeiro-based Petrobras reported lifting costs, the average expense to produce one barrel of oil equivalent, of $15.42 in the third quarter compared with $13.37 a year earlier. Mexico \u2019s state-run oil company Petroleos Mexicanos, known as Pemex, had lifting cost of $6.12 in 2011, according to the company\u2019s website.\nPetrobras reported in an Oct. 26 regulatory filing that net income unexpectedly fell 12 percent to 5.57 billion reais ($2.7 billion), or 43 centavos a share, from 6.34 billion, or 49 centavos, a year earlier. The company was expected to report adjusted profit of 58 centavos a share, the average estimate of seven analysts in a Bloomberg survey.\nThe stock fell as much as 3.9 percent to 21.25 reais as of 10:08 a.m. in Sao Paulo trading, the most since Aug. 6.\n\u201cWe continue working with a determined focus to recover the profitability of the company,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Maria das Gracas Foster said in the earnings release. \u201cWe\u2019re directing our best efforts at developing production.\u201d\nShares Drop\nShares have lost 3.1 percent for investors this year before today in U.S. dollar terms, the fourth worst performance by a global oil company with a market value of more than $50 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Colombia\u2019s Ecopetrol SA returned 54 percent, while Cnooc Ltd. registered a 22 percent return, the data show.\nOperators of drilling rigs are charging higher rates as demand for new deep-water equipment increases and the labor market tightens, said Bloomberg Industries analyst Christian O\u2019Neill. Costs are also rising as Brazilian inflation accelerated for a third month to 5.28 percent in September.\n\u201cGiven the shortage of labor and materials, and the specialization that\u2019s required, naturally you\u2019re going to put upward pressure on costs,\u201d O\u2019Neill said in a telephone interview from New Jersey. \u201cThat\u2019s an industry-wide phenomenon when you go into specialized deep-water offshore type of projects.\u201d\nPetrobras, which operates the largest fleet of production platforms of any oil company, plans to triple its drilling vessels by 2020. The producer had an average delivery delay of 542 days for 10 rigs built outside of Brazil and delivered in 2011, according to the 2012-2016 business plan it released June 14.\n\u2018Technical Breakthroughs\u2019\nDiamond Offshore Drilling (DO) Inc. Senior Vice President Gary Krenek said on an Oct. 18 conference call that the Houston-based drilling contractor will save $40,000 a day in operating costs by moving a rig out of Brazil. Noble Corp. (NE) Chief Executive Officer David Williams said on another call that same day that the Swiss driller \u201chappily\u201d doesn\u2019t have any big new projects in Brazil lined up.\nAs Petrobras gains knowledge of the conditions in the so- called pre-salt region in coming years, it will improve technology and become more efficient to reduce the costs of these projects, said Cleveland Jones, an oil specialist and geology professor at Rio de Janeiro State University.\n\u201cThere are a lot of technical breakthroughs that will make these original project estimates conservative,\u201d Jones said by telephone from Rio de Janeiro. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fully being accounted for.\u201d\nLocal-Content\nWhile the bulk of the rigs in Brazil are built and operated by foreign companies such as Noble and Diamond, the Brazilian government is pushing to increase the amount of locally manufactured rigs. Petrobras needs to purchase as much as 70 percent of its equipment from domestic suppliers to meet mandates set by former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\nOSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) , the shipbuilder controlled by billionaire Eike Batista , built its first platform outside of Brazil and has plans to construct the second and third vessels at sites abroad after its shipyard in the state of Rio de Janeiro was delayed.\nPetrobras has missed output goals for at least the past eight years as production from its deep-water discoveries failed to compensate for faster-than-expected declines at older fields in Brazil\u2019s offshore Campos Basin. The company, which forecasts its output to remain little changed through the end of 2013, has a track record of missing project deadlines as requirements to purchase goods and services from local suppliers contribute to delays, its CEO said on June 25 when presenting the company\u2019s five-year investment plan to investors and analysts.\n\u201cYou\u2019re spending the capital up front but don\u2019t really have the production to show for it yet,\u201d Bloomberg Industries\u2019 O\u2019Neill said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to put pressure on the operating metrics of the company.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Peter Millard in Rio de Janeiro at pmillard1@bloomberg.net ; Rodrigo Orihuela in Rio de Janeiro at rorihuela@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net ; Jessica Brice at jbrice1@bloomberg.net\nPetrobras Profit Falls as Drilling Costs Rise\nRich Press/Bloomberg\nPetrobras, which is investing $236.5 billion as it develops the Americas\u2019 largest oil finds in more than three decades, is struggling to contain surging labor and equipment costs as inflation accelerates after Brazil\u2019s central bank cut interest rates to a record low.\nPetrobras, which is investing $236.5 billion as it develops the Americas\u2019 largest oil finds in more than three decades, is struggling to contain surging labor and equipment costs as inflation accelerates after Brazil\u2019s central bank cut interest rates to a record low.

Per-share profit excluding some items trailed the 58- centavo average of seven analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nFuel imports are curbing profit as imported gasoline and diesel prices exceeded those in Brazil . In the quarter imported gasoline cost about 10 percent more than domestic fuel because the government, which control\u2019s Petrobras\u2019 board, fixed prices to rein in inflation, said Lucas Brendler, who helps manage about 6 billion reais at Banco Geracao Futuro de Investimentos.\n\u201cYou are still importing at a price much higher than you are selling in the downstream,\u201d Brendler said in a telephone interview from Porto Alegre , Brazil, before the report was released. \u201cThey have to solve this problem.\u201d\nPrice Increases\nPetrobras increased prices for gasoline and diesel by 7.8 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively, on June 25, and then lifted diesel prices an additional 6 percent on July 12 to reduce the discount with international prices. Still, Petrobras sells imported fuel at a loss and strong demand from farmers during Brazil\u2019s harvest season increased third-quarter imports, Jose Consenza, the head of refining at Petrobras, said in Rio de Janeiro on Oct. 9.\n\u201cThe downstream side of the house is really where they took a hit,\u201d Gianna Bern , president of risk-management consultant Brookshire Advisory & Research, Inc. in Chicago , said by telephone today. \u201cYou layer on the weaker Brazilian currency and it\u2019s a recipe for a challenging quarter.\u201d\nPetrobras\u2019s refining, transport and logistics division posted a loss of 5.65 billion reais compared with the 3.17 billion-real loss a year ago.\nBrent oil for December settlement rose 1 percent to close at $109.55 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange today.\nLargest Discovery\nPetrobras is heading for its first annual decline in output since 2004 after production slid for three months to 2.54 million barrels a day in August, the lowest since October 2010. Petrobras\u2019s production fell 0.5 percent in the first nine months of the year to an average of 2.59 million barrels a day. Petrobras plans to more than double output to 5.7 million barrels a day in 2020.\nPetrobras is investing $236.5 billion over five years to build refineries, develop deep-water fields and ramp up output at Lula, the largest discovery in Brazil\u2019s history. Petrobras produces more oil than any other company in waters deeper than 1,000 feet (305 meters) and is building dozens of platforms and drill ships to expand output.\nInvestments rose 18 percent to 59.8 billion reais in the first nine months of the year, with 48 percent of spending dedicated to exploration and production and 37 percent to refining, the company said.\nPetrobras rose 1.6 percent to 22.10 reais in Sao Paulo today.

Veolia owns 66 percent of Dalkia in France , and EDF holds the rest. Veolia Chief Executive Officer Antoine Frerot said in March the company was building an industrial partnership with EDF and changes within the shareholding of Dalkia may follow. EDF CEO Henri Proglio said Nov. 8 that ownership may become 50-50, which Frerot confirmed a month later. Veolia would have operational control of the venture, Frerot said.\nThe lawsuit, filed Oct. 22, is the latest sign of friction between Frerot and Proglio, who resigned from Veolia\u2019s board earlier this month. Proglio, who spent most of his career at Veolia, working his way up to chairman and CEO, now heads state- controlled EDF, Europe \u2019s biggest power generator and the owner of a 3.9 percent stake in Veolia.\nOriginal Principles\nIn recent months, Veolia held talks on a possible tie up with Suez Environnement, which is 34 percent owned by EDF\u2019s competitor GDF Suez (GSZ) SA, the former French gas monopoly, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions. The two utilities said Oct. 21 that a merger isn\u2019t planned. GDF Suez also has energy services businesses that compete with Dalkia.\nTwo weeks before EDF filed the lawsuit, Veolia said Proglio had resigned from the board.\nEDF and Veolia don\u2019t break out results for Dalkia, which reported 8.3 billion euros ($10.7 billion) in revenue last year, according to its website . EDF bought 34 percent of Dalkia in June 2000.\nFor antitrust reasons in France, where EDF was the power monopoly, EDF wasn\u2019t granted management control of Dalkia operations in France although it shares 50-50 control outside the domestic market.\nVeolia has pledged to sell billions of euros of assets and pull out of dozens of countries in a bid to lower debt and reverse losses.\nFrerot earlier this year reshuffled the Veolia board, which in February backed the slimming down of the utility and Frerot\u2019s position at the helm. This came after reports in the French press that Proglio had tried to garner support for Frerot\u2019s ouster.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Tara Patel in Paris at tpatel2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Will Kennedy at wkennedy3@bloomberg.net\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "CHILE65", "embersId": "625cb7a04fb4fdcd55ad07b8e0e36a85a33a2256"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-27 08:36:12", "postDate": "2012-10-27", "author": "Jonathan Stearns", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-27/gdf-suez-s-belgian-units-accused-of-tax-evasion-l-echo.html", "title": "GDF Suez\u2019s Belgian Units Accused of Tax Evasion: L'Echo", "updateTime": "2012-10-29 11:17:22", "content": "SIFMA Recommends Full Market Close on Oct 30\nGDF Suez\u2019s Belgian Units Accused of Tax Evasion: L'Echo\nBy Jonathan Stearns - 2012-10-27T12:36:12Z\nBelgium \u2019s tax authorities have accused Electrabel SA and other Belgian units of France \u2019s GDF Suez (GSZ) SA of evading 285 million euros ($369 million) in taxes between 2003 and 2008, L\u2019Echo reported, saying GDF Suez spokesman Kristof Scheldeman confirmed the allegations.\nGDF Suez contests the accusations of tax evasion, which allegedly took place via Electrabel subsidiaries in Luxembourg, the Belgian newspaper said.

That may help the Frankfurt-based lender boost its share of investment banking revenue among the world\u2019s largest banks for the first time in a year when it reports earnings tomorrow.\n\u201cDeutsche Bank suffered more than other firms with the crisis closer to its home markets, but they\u2019re also better positioned than peers to profit from the rebound,\u201d said Dirk Becker , an analyst with Kepler Capital Markets in Frankfurt, who recommends investors buy the shares. \u201cHanging on to their position as a top global investment bank is crucial to maintaining profits.\u201d\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi helped prompt a surge in sales of securities in the third quarter after pledging in August to conduct bond purchases to prop up some euro-region countries. An increase in such business is key for Deutsche Bank, which earned 45 percent of its income from investment banking last year.\nDeal Volume\nThe German bank, which saw revenue at the investment bank slide 11 percent to 3.5 billion euros ($4.5 billion) in the second quarter from a year earlier, probably profited from a higher volume of issuance as it battled for business with peers.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s 1.5 percentage point gain in the share of volume of debt and equity offerings was second only to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) \u2019s 2.3 percentage point jump among the nine biggest banks and compared with a 1.1 percentage point slide at UBS and 0.1 percentage point decline at Barclays, the data show. Morgan Stanley (MS) , UniCredit SpA (UCG) and Nomura Holdings Inc. also saw their portion of the market decline, according to the data.\nArmin Niedermeier, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, declined to comment on the firm\u2019s performance in the third quarter before the publication of its results tomorrow. Stephanie Aneto, a UBS spokeswoman in London , and Jon Laycock at Barclays also declined to comment.\nAnnual Decline\nDeutsche Bank may almost double revenue from debt sales to 331 million euros and boost income from equity issuance 40 percent to 95 million euros in the third-quarter, according to the average estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That may help the lender offset a decline in profit brought on by higher costs.\nInvestor demand for stocks and bonds has increased after Draghi said Sept. 6 that policy makers agreed to an unlimited bond-purchase program provided countries sign up to budget consolidation measures first. While no state has asked to tap that aid, Spanish and Italian 10-year bond yields have since declined to seven-month intraday lows in October.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s market share of foreign exchange trading also rose in the third quarter, according to a person familiar with the business who declined to be identified because the information is private.\nThe lender\u2019s share of a total $40.1 billion of revenue among the top 10 investment banks had decreased to 11 percent in the three months through June from 12 percent in the same period a year earlier, the data compiled by Bloomberg Industries show. That was the third-straight annual decline while Barclays increased its portion on a yearly basis in the first two quarters of 2012, according to the data.\nHurt by Europe\nBanks that rely more on Europe have been hit hardest by the sovereign debt crisis. Investment banking fees in Europe, the Middle East and Africa may fall 22 percent to $17.7 billion this year, more than the 9 percent slide for global fees, data from research firm Freeman & Co. show.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s offices in EMEA accounted for more than 70 percent of its 33.2 billion euros in revenue last year, company filings show. UBS got 52 percent of 27.8 billion Swiss francs ($29.8 billion) in operating income in Europe in 2011 while Barclays generated 57 percent of its 28.5 billion pounds ($45.9 billion) of revenue there.\nNet income at Deutsche Bank probably fell an annual 15 percent to 613 million euros in the third quarter, according to the average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Profit at UBS, which also reports tomorrow, may slide 51 percent to 495 million francs, while Barclays may say on Oct. 31 that net income dropped 60 percent to 463 million pounds, estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\u2018Upfront Pain\u2019\nThe cost of shedding jobs and offloading riskier assets is hurting Deutsche Bank\u2019s earnings. The lender said July 31 that it would trim its workforce by 1,900 positions, or almost 2 percent of staff, in a bid to boost profitability.\nWhile Deutsche Bank\u2019s third-quarter performance was \u201csolid, particularly in the investment bank,\u201d costs from job cuts and asset reduction require \u201cupfront pain,\u201d co-Chief Executive Officer Anshu Jain, 49, said at an investor conference in London on Sept. 25.\nDeutsche Bank probably took 240 million euros of restructuring charges and 69 million euros in costs for reducing risk-weighted assets in the third quarter, Credit Suisse (CSGN) analysts including Amit Goel in London wrote in an e-mailed report to investors on Oct. 23.\nIn September, Deutsche Bank said it faced 500 million euros in costs and revenue losses from shedding assets through the end of March next year.\nBest Summer\nDebt issuance has \u201cbeen pretty robust\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ve actually had the best summer for five years,\u201d Robert Rankin , who runs Deutsche Bank\u2019s investment bank together with Colin Fan, told analysts on Sept. 12 in Frankfurt.\nThe firm managed the sale of shares in German chemicals distributor Brenntag AG (BNR) and counted French utility GDF Suez (GSZ) SA among the clients it sold bonds for in the three months through September, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nWhile fees from issuing debt and equity will buoy revenue, they\u2019re typically dwarfed by trading for clients, making up 11 percent of the investment bank\u2019s total income in the second quarter, company filings show.\nTraders at Deutsche Bank may not have been fully positioned to profit from a rebound in markets in the last quarter as they focused on preparing for Basel III capital rules, said Andreas Plaesier , an analyst at M.M. Warburg.\n\u201cThey were reducing risk,\u201d said Plaesier, who is based in Hamburg and recommends investors buy Deutsche Bank shares. \u201cThey didn\u2019t necessarily bet on a market recovery.\u201d\nShares Outperform\nDeutsche Bank, Europe\u2019s largest bank by assets, is rated buy by 17 analysts, sell by 11 and hold by 16, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock will probably trade at 35.07 euros in 12 months, a 5.6 percent increase from its price at 10:56 a.m. in Frankfurt today, according to the average estimate of 34 analysts. The shares have climbed 13 percent this year, more than the 4.2 percent advance for the 28-company Euro Stoxx Bank Index. (SX7E)\nThe firm hasn\u2019t published a revenue target for its investment banking division. It places itself in the top three globally by compiling rankings using client market share, penetration or fees for different products and regions provided by external researchers, and its own estimates.\nDeutsche Bank was in fifth place for investment banking revenue in the second quarter, behind JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , Citigroup Inc. (C) and Barclays, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nThe bank is betting on clients turning to its securities unit, saying it expects competitors to retrench and investors to seek the counsel of the biggest banks amid uncertainty in financial markets.\n\u201cInvestment banks with more mass are generally able to offer their services to clients at lower cost,\u201d Plaesier said. \u201cGetting back into the business if you give up your position would require a lot of time and money.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Nicholas Comfort in Frankfurt at ncomfort1@bloomberg.net ; Annette Weisbach in Frankfurt at aweisbach1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Frank Connelly at fconnelly@bloomberg.net\nDeutsche Bank Beating UBS in Sign of Investment Bank Recovery\nHannelore Foerster/Bloomberg\nDeutsche Bank AG, which saw revenue at the investment bank slide 11 percent to 3.5 billion euros in the second quarter from a year earlier, probably profited from a higher volume of issuance as it battled for business with peers.\nDeutsche Bank AG, which saw revenue at the investment bank slide 11 percent to 3.5 billion euros in the second quarter from a year earlier, probably profited from a higher volume of issuance as it battled for business with peers.

UBS AG (UBSN) , Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and other Swiss banks are being forced to seek acquisitions as Latin America\u2019s $3.5 trillion wealth management market is set to grow by more than half by 2016, according to Boston Consulting Group.\n\u201cPeople are becoming richer and richer,\u201d said Gustavo Raitzin, head of Latin America for Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) \u201cAn emerging consumer class wants to make liquid investments and they need private banks and wealth managers, especially in Brazil.\u201d\nBrazilian Boom\nBrazil\u2019s private banking industry increased assets under management 50 percent to 434.3 billion reais ($214 billion) between 2009 and 2011, according to a survey by Anbima, the national banking association. Switzerland\u2019s biggest banks are looking to tap that growth.\nUBS, Switzerland\u2019s biggest bank, is in talks with Brasil Plural SA Multiplo, a Sao Paulo-based bank and asset manager to buy BNP Paribas SA\u2019s Brazil wealth-management unit for about $50 million, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Oct. 6. The companies declined to comment on the discussions.\nCredit Suisse this year increased its majority stake in Hedging-Griffo, a money manager in the same city that oversees 45 billion reais for wealthy individuals. The Zurich-based bank has identified Brazil and Mexico for domestic investment.\nBoth UBS and Credit Suisse, which each have at least eight offices in Latin America, declined to comment for this story on their strategies in the region.\nJulius Baer last year purchased a 30 percent stake in GPS Investimentos Financeiros e Participacoes SA, a Sao Paulo-based money manager for wealthy families that\u2019s trying to double its 11 billion reais in client assets over the next five years. The bank is also buying businesses in Uruguay, Chile and Panama through the acquisition of Merrill Lynch\u2019s wealth management assets outside the U.S. from Bank of America Corp. (BAC)\nTurmoil Trigger\n\u201cBrazilians only send money abroad in times of turmoil,\u201d said Winkelmann. \u201cTen years ago money was being wired abroad like hell. Now absolutely they\u2019re bringing it back. I don\u2019t see anyone making much money on an offshore business with low interest rates and the regulatory framework.\u201d\nEconomic growth has created a new class of entrepreneurs in Latin America\u2019s consumer industries, said Henrique Meirelles de Campos, a former head of the nation\u2019s central bank and now an adviser to Bedrock Group, a Geneva- and London-based private investment office.\n\u201cUntil 2003 Brazil was still in a period of recurrent financial crisis, short-term planning, short-term horizons, putting little investment into innovation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe financial system is now in good shape and the domestic market is growing.\u201d\nBrazil Growth\nBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s economic team forecasts that gross domestic product expanded at a 5 percent to 6 percent annualized pace in the third quarter, the fastest in more than two years, a government official said. In a bid to boost growth, Brazil\u2019s central bank this month cut its benchmark Selic to a record low 7.25 percent. The Swiss National Bank (SNBN) kept its benchmark interest rate at zero at a meeting in September.\n\u201cThere are opportunities for Swiss and other international managers but an emerging crowd of local players is also winning business in Brazil and Chile,\u201d said Jorge Becerra, a Santiago- based consultant with Boston Consulting. \u201cLatin American banks are making acquisitions to try to build pan-Andean managers.\u201d\nThe need for asset protection, which spurred the creation of offshore Swiss accounts, still has a role, said Karen Simpson, head of RBC Wealth Management , a unit of Royal Bank of Canada, in Geneva, where about 40 percent of the 7.5 billion francs ($8 billion) under management are for Latin American clients.\nOffshore Appeal\n\u201cIf you are a Latin American sitting in an environment that is turbulent, be it economically, politically, or socially, you probably choose to have offshore sites for a portion of your money,\u201d she said.\nAbout a third of the $1.5 trillion banked offshore by Latin Americans sits in accounts managed in Switzerland, according to a UBS presentation .\nStill, Swiss wealth managers are no longer simply about a deposit account that\u2019s less vulnerable than one at home, said Magda Gabriel, head of HSBC Holdings Plc\u2019s Latin American desk in Switzerland.\n\u201cWhereas a couple of years ago you would be focusing on offshore private banking I would say that\u2019s kind of history,\u201d said Gabriel, while adding that HSBC\u2019s Swiss business is looking for referrals from local banks it has acquired in Brazil, Mexico and Panama. \u201cIt\u2019s helped us to develop our international business.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Giles Broom in Geneva at gbroom@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Frank Connelly at fconnelly@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IBOV", "embersId": "3259992fa7286400cc4543c488145187eda30b92"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-26 12:29:40", "postDate": "2012-10-26", "author": "Aaron Kirchfeld, Matthew Campbell , Tino Andresen", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-26/thyssenkrupp-said-to-ask-for-new-bids-for-americas-plants.html", "title": "ThyssenKrupp Said to Ask for New Bids for Americas Plants", "updateTime": "2012-10-29 11:15:04", "content": "SIFMA Recommends Full Market Close on Oct 30\nThyssenKrupp Said to Ask for New Bids for Americas Plants\nBy Aaron Kirchfeld, Matthew Campbell and Tino Andresen - 2012-10-26T16:29:40Z\nThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) , Germany \u2019s biggest steelmaker, has asked companies to resubmit offers for its unprofitable Americas unit after original bids were deemed too low, according to people familiar with the matter.\nInterested bidders must hand in new bids to the Essen-based company by the deadline today, said the people, who asked not to be identified because talks are private.

The lender will also convert 366.7 million reais ($181 million) of Marfrig bonds into shares as part of the offering, according to a Oct. 24 filing. Without the additional purchase, the BNDES stake in Marfrig would drop to about 12 percent.\nMarfrig\u2019s debt tripled in the past two years to a record 9.3 billion reais at the end of the third quarter after the company made 20 acquisitions since 2007. The company, which follows meatpacker Minerva SA in selling shares to cut debt, said this week it plans to raise about 1.1 billion reais.\nBNDES, whose equity investment in Marfrig has lost 45 percent since 2007, bought 2.5 billion reais of convertible bonds to help Marfrig acquire a McDonald\u2019s Corp. supplier in 2010.

Galvin said Oct. 26 in a statement. Weeks before the IPO, a junior analyst at the unit e-mailed two employees at TechCrunch.com seeking feedback on a Facebook document that contained a senior analyst\u2019s view of investment risks and revenue estimates, Galvin said.\nA slump in Facebook\u2019s stock after the May 18 offering has fueled shareholder complaints, regulatory probes and more than 40 lawsuits, with some investors claiming the social-network company\u2019s managers failed to revise forecasts before the IPO. Citigroup\u2019s e-mail exchanges were provided to Galvin\u2019s office on Sept. 14 in response to a subpoena, and the junior analyst was terminated about two weeks later, the watchdog said.\nGalvin faulted the Citigroup subsidiary for failing to supervise its analysts. The firm settled, admitted to a statement of facts and pledged to abide by state securities laws, he said.\n\u201cWe are pleased to have this matter resolved,\u201d Sophia Stewart, a Citigroup spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. \u201cWe take our internal policies and procedures very seriously and have taken the appropriate actions.\u201d\nAccording to a person with direct knowledge of the matter, Citigroup has also fired Mark Mahaney , a senior technology analyst.

(XLNX) wouldn\u2019t meet its revenue forecasts, the SEC said Oct. 26 in a statement. Rajaratnam shorted Xilinx stock and reaped illicit profits of $978,684 after the news was made public.\nWhen he passed the tip, Chellam had money invested with Galleon and was in talks with Rajaratnam about taking a job at the hedge fund, the SEC said. Chellam was Xilinix\u2019s chief financial officer at Xilinx from 1998 to 2005, the SEC said. In 2007, he was made co-managing partner of the Galleon Special Opportunities Fund, a venture capital fund that focused on technology companies.\nRajaratnam is serving an 11-year sentence in a Massachusetts federal prison after being convicted last year of insider trading . Chellam hasn\u2019t been charged with a crime.\nChristopher Steskal, a lawyer for Chellam, didn\u2019t immediately return a call seeking comment about the complaint.

(WAG)\nFlanagan, 65, who pleaded guilty to a single count of securities fraud in August, was also sentenced to one year of supervised release by U.S. District Judge Robert M. Dow in Chicago. Flanagan left Deloitte in 2008, ending an association with the New York-based firm and its predecessors that lasted more than three decades.\nFlanagan served as an advisory partner and liaison between the audit-management teams of Walgreen, Best Buy and Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD) and the firm\u2019s auditors, according to the original charging papers filed in July.\nHis job gave him access to non-public information involving those companies and the technology firm formerly known as Motorola Inc., including quarterly earnings results and potential acquisition targets, according to a plea agreement he signed in August.\nCiting Flanagan\u2019s plea, penance and devotion to family and community, defense attorney Joel Levin asked Dow to impose a sentence of six months\u2019 incarceration and 1,000 hours of community service.\nProsecutors said Flanagan\u2019s personal history didn\u2019t outweigh the severity of his crime and argued for a punishment that would promote deterrence.\nJonathan Gandal, a spokesman for Deloitte, said in an August e-mail that the firm sued Flanagan after it learned what he did.\n\u201cDeloitte unequivocally condemns the actions of this individual,\u201d Gandal said.\nFlanagan and his son Patrick agreed in 2010 to pay more than $1.1 million to settle related insider-trading claims brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe case is U.S. v.

An earlier draft of the plan prepared by European Union member states had called for the ECB to present a \u201creasoned decision\u201d before stepping in to supervise such lenders.\n\u201cNational competent authorities should be responsible for assisting the ECB on its request,\u201d according to the document. The ECB should be in charge of thrashing out how this cooperation will work, the commission said.\nCyprus, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, proposed last week that the ECB should only be allowed to take over oversight for such lenders if financial stability is under threat. The ECB would also be required to consult with national regulators and explain its reasoning before stepping in.\nEBF\u2019s Clausen Says EU Likely to Delay Basel Bank Rule Overhaul\nBanks in the European Union expect the bloc to delay applying the latest round of Basel bank capital rules as political negotiations on the measures drag on, the head of a lobbying group said.\nChristian Clausen , president of the European Banking Federation, said the EU will push back the planned Jan. 1 start date for phasing in the standards because uncertainty over the final rules risks leaving lenders with additional costs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s of course a major concern,\u201d Clausen, who is also chief executive officer of Nordea Bank AB (NDA) , said in an interview in Brussels on Oct. 26. \u201cI\u2019m sure the date will be postponed.\u201d\nThe EU has struggled to agree on how to apply the Basel capital rules for banks as legislators and officials spar over curbs on bonuses and how to ensure lenders can weather funding squeezes. The measures would more than triple the core capital that banks must hold as a buffer against insolvency.\nThe Jan. 1 deadline was agreed on by the Group of 20 nations in 2010. The rules were drawn up by global regulators in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.\nThe lack of legal certainty, coupled with the international deadline, means that banks might be forced to rely on draft versions of the rules for guidance on how to overhaul their internal compliance and reporting systems, Clausen said.\nLenders would then incur extra costs when they have to adapt again to the final standards, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cost issue, a very simple cost issue\u201d he said, adding that the situation may also create confusion for investors.\nThe EBF brings together national associations of banks in the 27-nation EU.\nIn the Courts\nArgentina Loses U.S. Appeal of Ruling on Defaulted Bonds\nArgentina can\u2019t make payments on restructured sovereign debt while refusing to pay holders of its defaulted bonds, a U.S. appeals court ruled in a victory for creditors including Elliott Management Corp.\u2019s NML Capital Fund.\nThe U.S. Appeals Court in New York on Oct. 26 upheld lower- court decisions, which may help creditors who rejected the country\u2019s restructuring offers collect $1.4 billion in defaulted debt. Argentine bonds dropped the most in four months on the news.\n\u201cWe hold that an equal treatment provision in the bonds bars Argentina from discriminating against plaintiffs\u2019 bonds in favor of bonds issued in connection with the restructurings,\u201d U.S. Circuit Judge Barrington Parker said in the opinion.\nThe appeals court, which upheld orders issued by U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan, rejected Argentina\u2019s claims that the move would undermine its debt agreements, trigger a new financial crisis in the republic and make it impossible for countries including Greece, Spain and Portugal, to restructure their debt in the future. Argentina defaulted on more than $80 billion in foreign bonds in 2001.\nThe appeals court sent the case back to Griesa to clarify how a payment formula set by the judge is intended to work and to determine how the orders apply to intermediary banks and other third parties. After Griesa rules on those issues, the case will return to the appeals court for a review of his decisions, Parker said.\nJonathan Blackman, a lawyer representing Argentina, didn\u2019t immediately return a phone message seeking comment on the ruling. The Argentine state news agency Telam, however said the country will appeal the ruling, citing Argentine Finance Secretary Adrian Cosentino.\nPeter Truell , a spokesman for Elliott, declined to comment.\nIn its decision, the appeals court said the equal treatment, or pari passu, clause in the bond agreement means that Argentina can\u2019t subordinate the interests of the defaulted bondholders to those of investors who chose to participate in debt restructurings in 2005 and 2010.\nThe appeals court said its ruling is unlikely to hamper other countries that may try to restructure their debt in the future. Almost all the bonds issued since January 2005 that are covered by New York law include \u201ccollective action clauses,\u201d provisions that allow a super-majority of bondholders to agree on a debt restructuring that is binding on all holders, according to the court.\nThe case is NML Capital Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, 12-00105, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).\nFor more, click here.\nWells Fargo Loses Bid to Force Arbitration in Overdraft Case\nWells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the biggest U.S. home lender, lost a bid to force the arbitration of customer disputes about overdraft fees.\nThe bank can\u2019t force arbitration after twice waiving its right to do so, the U.S. Appeals Court based in Atlanta ruled on Oct. 26, denying the bank\u2019s motion to dismiss a class-action lawsuit.\nThe court found that the bank put the customers through a litigation process that lasted years and yielded about 900,000 documents before asserting its right to force the customers to arbitrate their dispute.\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed with the ruling,\u201d Richele Messick, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. The company will continue to defend its position in the litigation, she said.\nCustomers have sued more than 30 banks claiming they reordered overdrafts to maximize fees. Bank of America Corp. agreed to pay $410 million last year to settle customer claims and JPMorgan Chase & Co. reached a preliminary agreement in February to pay $110 million to resolve a lawsuit. A suit against other banks is pending in federal court in Miami.\nWells Fargo, based in San Francisco , declined a trial court\u2019s offer to arbitrate the disputes in November 2009 and April 2010. The company filed a motion to dismiss five proposed class-action, or group, lawsuits two days after the Supreme Court ruled in April that federal law allows companies to compel customers and employees to arbitrate claims individually, trumping state laws that may bar such provisions.\nBefore the Supreme Court ruling, laws in some states made arbitration provisions that contained class-action waivers unenforceable, the bank said.\nWells Fargo acted \u201cinconsistently\u201d with the arbitration right, the appeals court said.\n\u201cIf we were to compel arbitration, the plaintiffs would suffer substantial prejudice,\u201d the court said.\nThe appeals case is Garcia v. Wachovia, 11-16029, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The trial court case is In Re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation, 09-md-02036, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida (Miami).\nAdoboli Says He Booked Fake Trades to Conceal Profit, Losses\nKweku Adoboli, the former UBS AG (UBSN) trader accused of causing the largest unauthorized trading loss in British history, said he booked fake trades to hide profits and losses on real transactions and others on his desk knew what he was doing and helped him.\nAdoboli, 32, first booked a so-called holding trade in late 2008 in order to take another off his desk\u2019s book to hide the risk, he testified on Oct. 26 as he took the stand for the first time in his fraud trial.\n\u201cI had seen traders in my peer group and traders more senior than me either hold positions off-book by not booking them as soon as they did the trade, or by booking a covering trade to take them beyond the first day or two,\u201d Adoboli said during testimony that lasted about four hours. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that what we were doing was illegitimate.\u201d\nAdoboli is accused of booking fake hedges to hide the risk of trades, causing the Swiss bank a $2.3 billion loss. He was charged in September of last year with two counts each of fraud and false accounting.\nProsecutors on Oct. 26 added two more false accounting charges tied to his so-called umbrella account. He has pleaded not guilty.\nAdoboli tearfully told jurors that he neglected family and friends, working as many as 16 hours a day and twice sleeping at the office for the benefit of UBS\u2019s exchange-traded-funds desk.\nFor more, click here.\nEx-Citic Pacific Executive Chui Convicted of Insider Trading\nCitic Pacific Ltd.

The rules were drawn up by global regulators in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision .\nThe lack of legal certainty, coupled with the international deadline, means that banks might be forced to rely on draft versions of the rules for guidance on how to overhaul their internal compliance and reporting systems, Clausen said.\nLenders would then incur extra costs when they have to adapt again to the final standards, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cost issue, a very simple cost issue\u201d he said, adding that the situation may also create confusion for investors.\nThe EBF brings together national associations of banks in the 27-nation EU.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jim Brunsden in Brussels at jbrunsden@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anthony Aarons at aaarons@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IBOV", "embersId": "0142ac1cec2689c904887b3e4f5f3c5513295bd8"}], "MEXBOL": [{"postTime": "2012-10-26 17:46:19", "postDate": "2012-10-26", "author": "David de Jong", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-26/world-s-wealthiest-drop-18-billion-on-weak-earnings-data.html", "title": "World\u2019s Wealthiest Drop $18 Billion on Weak Earnings Data", "updateTime": "2012-10-29 11:13:27", "content": "SIFMA Recommends Full Market Close on Oct 30\nWorld\u2019s Wealthiest Drop $18 Billion on Weak Earnings Data\nBy David de Jong - 2012-10-26T21:46:19Z\nThe 100 richest people on the planet dropped $17.7 billion from their collective net worth this week after disappointing corporate earnings in the U.S. were compounded by worries over economic growth.\nJeff Bezos , founder of Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the world\u2019s largest online retailer, lost $120 million. The Seattle-based company reported revenue that was less than analysts\u2019 estimates and posted the first quarterly net loss since 2003.

Monthly bills fell 16 percent even as voice traffic rose 14 percent, suggesting customers are paying less even as they use their phones more.\n\u201cBrazil\u2019s still a train wreck,\u201d said King of Stifel Nicolaus. \u201cUntil that gets better, it\u2019s hard to see the stock really working well.\u201d\nIn Mexico, where America Movil has 70 percent of mobile- phone subscribers, voice traffic surged 22 percent from a year earlier. The average price per minute fell 18 percent because of fee cuts mandated by regulators.\nTelmex (TELMEXL) , America Movil\u2019s land-line unit in Mexico, continued to struggle to keep customers from switching to mobile providers or competitors such as cable companies.

South and Central America sales were 5.5 billion pesos, up 20 percent from a year earlier.\nLarger wheat crops for 2013 and savings after completing the integration of new businesses should help Bimbo earnings improve next year, said Miguel Mayorga, an analyst at GBM Grupo Bursatil Mexicano in Mexico City.\n\u201cThe long-term uncertainty about wheat prices is almost gone,\u201d he said in a telephone interview before the report was released.\nQuarterly financing costs increased to 607 million pesos from 156 million pesos the prior year, Bimbo said.\nShares rose 1 percent to 32.58 pesos on the Mexican Stock Exchange today.

It halted travel, prevented U.S. stock markets from opening and upended the presidential campaign. It may cause more than $6 billion in damage and knock out power to 10 million for a week or more.\n\u201cWe have to take this seriously,\u201d PresidentBarack Obama said of what he called \u201ca serious and big storm.\u201d\nSandy packed maximum sustained winds of 85 miles (140 kilometers) per hour, up from 75 mph earlier, the National Hurricane Center said at 8 a.m. New York time. The storm\u2019s eye was about 310 miles south-southeast of New York, moving at 20 mph. It is not expected to weaken before landfall at Cape May, new Jersey , the center said. It may bring a surge as high as 10 feet (3 meters) in Manhattan.\nThe hurricane, blamed for 65 deaths in the Caribbean before it began barreling toward the U.S. East Coast, is expected to converge with two other systems, creating a phenomenon the National Weather Service has dubbed Frankenstorm.\nShip Abandoned\nOff North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks, the crew of the HMS Bounty , a replica of the vessel that was the scene of a 1789 mutiny, was forced to abandon ship when it capsized amid 18-foot seas. The crew took to lifeboats while the Coast Guard hoisted them to safety in helicopters, Kevin Sullivan , a Wilmington, North Carolina-based spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard, said by phone today. Two remained missing after 14 were rescued, the guard said in a statement.\nAll U.S. equity markets will be closed today, including the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq , the Securities and Exchange Commission said late yesterday. Businesses and banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc., told employees to work from home as some lower Manhattan offices would be closed. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association recommended that U.S. bond trading end today at noon New York time.\nGetting Wet\nAt 8 a.m., the city\u2019s streets were nearly empty of pedestrians and storefronts were dark. Wind made the storm\u2019s first raindrops sting. In Hoboken, a New Jersey town across the Hudson from Lower Manhattan, the river spilled into parks, onto Sinatra Drive along the waterfront and streamed into the Beaux Arts rail terminal.\n\u201cThe river is about where it was last year at the peak of Irene and we\u2019re expecting it to go higher,\u201d said Juan Melli, a spokesman for the city and Mayor Dawn Zimmer.\nA steady flow of customers lined up at the Dunkin Donuts on Hillside Avenue in New Hyde Park, New York, on the high ground between flood zones on the Atlantic Ocean and Long Island Sound. Emergency medical technician Widley Jeanmarie parked his ambulance outside and ordered a coffee before what could be a 24-hour shift.\n\u201cNothing yet,\u201d he said, \u201cBut I know there are going to be a lot of calls.\u201d\nRoads on the island were sparsely trafficked about 8:30 a.m., as wind bent treetops and shook cars.\nBuilding Barriers\nThe Coast Guard station in Atlantic City, New Jersey, was nearly surrounded with water this morning during high tide, and a skeleton crew of about 12 remained. Some took their vehicles down the road to an elevated parking garage at the Golden Nugget casino. Sand bags were stacked at its doors.\nSandy\u2019s punch may be felt from Virginia to Massachusetts, said Rick Knabb, the hurricane center\u2019s director. Warnings of gusts as strong as 70 miles per hour stretch from Maine to North Carolina and as far west as Ohio, according to the National Weather Service .\nObama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney shifted their campaign schedules and canceled appearances. Obama, who had planned a rally in Orlando this morning, is returning to Washington to monitor the storm, White House spokesman Jay Carney said in an e-mailed statement. Obama called off a trip to Wisconsin tomorrow.\nFlights Grounded\nInsured losses may exceed $6 billion in the U.S., led by costs in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and New York, according to estimates from Kinetic Analysis Corp. compiled by Bloomberg. As many as 10 million people may lose power, according to Seth Guikema, a Johns Hopkins University engineer whose computer model shows the storm\u2019s potential effects.\nAlmost 6,000 flights were canceled in the U.S. through tomorrow, according to FlightAware, a Houston-based tracking company, and mass transit stopped in New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia and Washington.\nCrude oil fell for the first time in three days in New York while gasoline prices rose as refineries curbed operations. Phillips 66, NuStar Energy LP (NS) and Hess Corp. (HES) shut or reduced output at New Jersey refineries ahead of the storm\u2019s landfall.\nNew York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, issued evacuation orders for 375,000 people and opened 72 shelters before the 7 p.m. closing yesterday of the city\u2019s mass-transit system.\nConnecticut\u2019s Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy ordered evacuation of areas home to 363,000 people as the storm threatened to pile up water in Long Island Sound, the state\u2019s southern shoreline.\nIn New Jersey, Republican Governor Chris Christie ordered coastal barrier islands and casinos in Atlantic City evacuated.\nCut Off\nOn the island of Brigantine, connected to Atlantic City by one bridge, about 70 percent of the town\u2019s 9,500 residents remained, said James Bennett, director of its office of emergency management.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve basically been told to expect to survive on our own for a while if we get cut off,\u201d he said in an interview yesterday at the police station.\nThe storm is also affecting the Nov. 6 elections.

Deprez - 2012-10-29T09:07:46Z\nPlay\nMust Watch: Hurricane Sandy and the Wall of Water\nHurricane Sandy, on track to disrupt the lives of as many as 60 million people, shut schools and governments from Virginia to Massachusetts today, halted travel, prevented U.S. stock markets from opening and upended the presidential campaign.\n\u201cThe time for preparing and talking is about over,\u201d said Craig Fugate , administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency . Sandy \u201cis going to produce very high, potentially life- threatening, storm surge.\u201d\nThe hurricane is predicted to make landfall late today in southern New Jersey, then turn inland, according to an advisory from the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Sandy is expected to converge with two other systems, creating a phenomenon the National Weather Service has dubbed Frankenstorm.\nSandy packed maximum sustained winds of 85 miles (140 kilometers) per hour, up from 75 mph earlier, the center said at 5 a.m. New York time. The storm\u2019s eye was about 285 miles east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and about 385 miles south- southeast of New York, moving north at 15 mph. It is not expected to weaken before landfall, the center said.\nDeadly Weather\nThe system, which killed as many as 65 people as it moved through the Caribbean, may cause $18 billion in damage and knock out power to 10 million for a week or more. As Sandy approached, travel hubs became choked with people making last-minute dashes home, while few pedestrians made their way along usually thronged streets.\nPresident Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney shifted their campaign schedules and canceled appearances. Early voting from Virginia to Ohio may be affected.\nU.S. federal government offices in the Washington area will be open only for emergency personnel beginning today, and state governments curtailed operations, too. The U.S. Commerce Department said reports today on personal incomes and spending would be released online in any case. The Department of Agriculture said some crop reports would be delayed.\nAll U.S. equity markets will be closed today, including the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said late yesterday. Broadway went dark. Businesses and banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc., told employees to work from home as some lower Manhattan offices would be closed. The Securities Industry and  Financial Markets Association recommended that U.S. bond trading  end today at noon New York time.\nWide Swath\nSandy\u2019s punch may be felt from Virginia to Massachusetts, said Rick Knabb, the hurricane center\u2019s director. The combined weather systems may dump as much as 36 inches (91 centimeters) of snow on West Virginia. Warnings of gusts as strong as 70 miles per hour stretch from Maine to North Carolina and as far west as Ohio, according to the National Weather Service .\nDamage may range from $15 billion to $18 billion, said Charles Watson, research and development director at Kinetic Analysis Corp., a hazard-analysis company in Silver Spring, Maryland. As many as 10 million people may lose power, according to Seth Guikema, a Johns Hopkins University engineer whose computer model shows the storm\u2019s potential effects.\nAlmost 6,000 flights were canceled in the U.S. through tomorrow, according to FlightAware, a Houston-based tracking company, and mass transit stopped in New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia and Washington.\nIn New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo , a Democrat, activated 1,175 National Guard troops, including 400 sent to Long Island and 200 dispatched to New York City.\nCoastal Evacuations\nConnecticut\u2019s Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy ordered evacuation of areas home to 363,000 people as the storm threatened to pile up water in Long Island Sound, the state\u2019s southern shoreline.\nNew York Mayor Michael Bloomberg issued evacuation orders for 375,000 people and opened more than 70 shelters before the 7 p.m. closing yesterday of the city\u2019s mass-transit system, the largest in the U.S. It was the second weather-related shutdown of the 24-hour subway system in its 108-year history, after the stoppage during last year\u2019s Hurricane Irene , which caused $2.6 billion in damage from the Carolinas to Vermont and killed 40.\nWinds may cause a surge as high as a record 11 feet (3 meters), said Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.\nIn New Jersey, Republican Governor Chris Christie ordered coastal barrier islands and casinos in Atlantic City evacuated.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re staying there, you\u2019re just stupid -- I mean, just plain stupid to stay,\u201d Christie said yesterday at a news briefing in West Trenton.\nHunkering Down\nOn the island of Brigantine, which is connected to Atlantic City by one bridge, about 70 percent of the town\u2019s 9,500 residents remained, said James Bennett, director of its office of emergency management.\n\u201cMy confidence is not very high,\u201d he said in an interview at the police station. \u201cWe\u2019ve basically been told to expect to survive on our own for a while if we get cut off.\u201d\nThe storm is also affecting the Nov. 6 elections. Maryland\u2019s Democratic Governor Martin O\u2019Malley said the state would cancel early voting today, and polling stations will be open Nov. 2 instead. Virginia\u2019s Board of Elections is open for extended hours to handle absentee voting driven by the storm, Republican Governor Bob McDonnell said. Connecticut extended its voter-registration deadline by two days, to Nov. 1.\nObama and Romney scrapped visits to storm-threatened states and headed to other competitive, vote-rich areas -- the president to Florida and his rival to Ohio.\nElection Wildcard\nDemocratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said the weather would \u201cthrow havoc\u201d into the race, and Republican pollster Whit Ayres said it might be enough to change its course.\n\u201cAnything could be significant in races that are this tight,\u201d said Ayres, who isn\u2019t affiliated with either campaign.\nResidents along the East Coast had more mundane concerns.\nMargarita Noriega, 28, a public-affairs professional in Washington\u2019s Mount Pleasant neighborhood, reinforced four windows with tape, filled her bathtub with water, stocked up on nonperishable food such as beef jerky and energy bars, bought a back-up charger for her mobile phone and cleaned out her home\u2019s gutters.\n\u201cThey said three storms were going to get together and have a party,\u201d said Jackie Socorso, 63, who dug blankets from her car and headed for the shelter at William Penn High School near her home in New Castle, Delaware.\nStocking Up\nSupermarket operator Kroger Co. (KR) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) stocked their shelves with supplies. New York City hardware stores papered windows with signs urging passers-by to be prepared. Home Depot Inc. (HD) extended hours in many of its stores in the Northeast as people purchase plywood for windows, fasteners, flashlights, batteries, water and generators, said Doug Spiron, who runs the company\u2019s storm center.\nIn Takoma Park, Maryland, a Washington suburb, Carol Blymire was preparing with a \u201ccook off the fridge\u201d party with neighbors.\nBlymire, 44, a freelance food writer, said the menu includes two whole roasted chickens, braised pork shoulder, roasted kale and polenta with meatballs and poached egg.\n\u201cThe rule is, everything that\u2019s perishable that would require use of the oven, we\u2019re going to make,\u201d she said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Esme E.

The biggest harvest ever was 542 million pounds in 2007, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.\nThree-quarters of U.S. pumpkins are carved for decoration during the Oct. 31 Halloween festival. While drought damaged corn and soybean fields, sending prices to records, pumpkins tracked by the USDA fetched $4.47 each on average at the end of last month, 3 percent less than the 2011 average because of ample supplies for retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)\n\u201cWe have seen the most-plentiful pumpkin crops ever,\u201d said Pam Bengtson, the co-owner of Bengtson\u2019s pumpkin farm in Homer Glen, Illinois, who plans to buy as much as 500 tons, or 50,000 pumpkins, this year.\nOctober is the peak month at Bengtson\u2019s farm , located about 31 miles (50 kilometers) southwest of downtown Chicago . She and her husband, Dave, expect as many as 100,000 visitors to buy, carve and even launch pumpkins 2,000 feet into a distant pond with its \u201cPunkin Chucker.\u201d\nThe orange vegetable is usually planted from late May to early July and harvested in late September or early October. This year\u2019s drought included the warmest weather since 1936 in Illinois, the largest U.S. grower of corn and soybeans after Iowa . Field conditions began deteriorating in June, and by July more than 95 percent of the state was experiencing a severe drought, according to the Drought Monitor in Lincoln, Nebraska .\nDrought Damage\nProduction of corn, the biggest and most-valuable U.S. crop, probably will tumble 13 percent this year, the USDA said Oct. 11. In June, before the drought took hold, the agency was predicting a 20 percent increase and a record harvest. Prices are up more than 46 percent since mid-June and reached a record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10.\n\u201cPumpkins are a hardy, hardy vegetable\u201d that thrives on hot, dry weather, said Daniel Fournie, the president of the Illinois Vegetable Growers Association in Collinsville. \u201cOur pumpkins have not had an ounce of water. You\u2019ve gotta scratch your head about that one. It\u2019s one for the books.\u201d\nUnlike most farms growing corn or soybeans, about half the pumpkin fields in Illinois are irrigated. Those with their own water supply are producing on average 18-pound jack-o-lanterns and record crops, compared with 14 pounds to 15 pounds on non- irrigated farms, said Steve Reiners, an associate professor in horticulture at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York .\nBest Ever\nEven with lower prices, the value of the state\u2019s output this year may surpass last year\u2019s $21.9 million, University of Illinois\u2019 Babadoost said.\n\u201cSome growers say they have the best crop ever\u201d because the hot weather helped reduce crop diseases, he said.\nFrom June 1 to Aug. 31, the temperature reached or exceeded 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 Celsius) on 61 days in Peoria, Illinois, about 17 miles west of Morton , the self-proclaimed pumpkin capital of the world, National Weather Service data show. Growers who planted before or after the hottest days did not suffer any damages, Babadoost said.\nCarving pumpkins in the U.S. dates back to the 1850\u2019s, when English and Irish immigrants adapted their tradition of fashioning turnips into frightening figures to keep away bad spirits, according to history professor, Gerry Bowler, at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada . The practice became more common with the development of Halloween festivities.\nHalloween Spending\nOn average, each American will spend $79.82 on costumes, candy and decorations, including pumpkins, for Halloween, up from $72.31 in 2011 because of higher prices, according to the National Retail Federation\u2019s Halloween Consumer Spending survey.\nDemand rose in the late 1980\u2019s with the emerging popularity of pick-your-own farms across the country, Cornell\u2019s Reiners said. Last year, Americans spent $113 million on pumpkins, according to data compiled from the six-top producing states by the USDA.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got people that are willing to spend incredible amounts of money to have that farm experience,\u201d Reiners said. \u201cGrowers started to realize this could be a real money-making crop.\u201d\nAbout one-quarter of the U.S. crop are light brown pumpkins without ribs that are canned or used in pie filling, said Suzanne Thornsbury, a USDA economist in Washington , D.C. Morton, Illinois-based Libby\u2019s, a unit of Nestle SA (NESN) , produces about four of every five cans of canned pumpkin sold in the U.S. A 29-ounce can of 100 Percent Pure Pumpkin sells for $3.19, unchanged from last year, the company said.\nDrought Epicenter\n\u201cThe many thousands of acres of pumpkin we grow are located right in the midst of the drought-stricken area,\u201d said Roz O\u2019Hearn, a Nestle spokeswoman in Solon, Ohio .\nPumpkin quality has remained high even with the drought, mostly because heat does less damage to crops than too much moisture, O\u2019Hearn said. In 2009, rainfall that was twice the previous record saturated fields and damaged crops. Speculators sold cans of pumpkin at \u201cexorbitant\u201d prices on Ebay Inc. (EBAY) , she said.\n\u201cAlthough dry years scare farmers, it\u2019s the wet, flooding years that really kills them,\u201d Cornell\u2019s Reiners said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Patricia Laya in New York at playa2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Steve Stroth at sstroth@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "MEXBOL", "embersId": "f83d58d6f5a53c8373fa7119b44e4d7b0a36f9a8"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-28 15:21:17", "postDate": "2012-10-28", "author": "Brian K.

Sullivan - 2012-10-28T19:21:17Z\nHurricane Sandy pounded toward land with \u201clife-threatening\u201d wind and waves, grounding almost 6,000 flights, forcing a halt to New York City area transit and prompting evacuations.\nThe system, which killed as many as 65 people in the Caribbean on its path north, may be powerful enough to cause $18 billion in damage when it barrels into New Jersey tomorrow and might knock out power to millions for a week or more, according to forecasters and risk experts.\n\u201cWe want to emphasize that the time for preparing and talking is about over now,\u201d said Craig Fugate , administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency . Whether Sandy hits as a hurricane or just a large storm, \u201cit is going to produce very high, potentially life-threatening, storm surge. It may require additional evacuations today.\u201d\nThe threat of that water coming onto shore prompted New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to call for the evacuation of low- lying areas including Battery Park City, Coney Island, City Island and the Rockaways, affecting about 375,000 people. It\u2019s only the second evacuation in the city\u2019s history, after the precaution taken for last year\u2019s Irene. Residents of parts of the New Jersey shore were also ordered to leave home.\nStorm\u2019s Breadth\nSandy\u2019s punch may be felt from Virginia to Massachusetts , said Rick Knabb, the National Hurricane Center\u2019s director. High wind warnings and watches for gusts as strong as 70 miles (113 kilometers) per hour stretch from Maine to North Carolina and as far west as Ohio, according to the National Weather Service . Flood watches and warnings cover most of the Northeast and mid- Atlantic coasts.\n\u201cI hope people realize how bad this can be,\u201d said Tom Kines , a meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc. in State College , Pennsylvania . Even if Sandy loses its hurricane status, \u201cpeople have to realize that the damage is going to be just as bad whether it is a hurricane or not. If it isn\u2019t a hurricane, they shouldn\u2019t put their guard down.\u201d\nSandy\u2019s maximum sustained winds remained unchanged at 75 miles (120 kilometers) per hour, the hurricane center said today in an advisory at 1 p.m. New York time. It was centered about 270 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and about 575 miles south of New York, moving northeast at 14 mph.\nWind Field\nHurricane-strength winds of at least 74 mph extend 175 from Sandy\u2019s core and tropical storm force reach 520 miles, according to the hurricane center. The storm is the second-largest since 1988, tied with Hurricane Lili in 1996, according to Angela Fritz at Weather Underground in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The largest was Hurricane Olga in 2001.\nSandy is expected to hook into the U.S. East Coast in southern New Jersey early Oct. 30, sending a 6- to 10-foot (1.8- to 3-meter) storm surge into the coast as far north as New York City and spreading wind gusts up to 80 miles per hour throughout the Northeast as well, Kines said.\nIn all, 50 million to 60 million people may be affected by the storm, Louis Uccellini, director of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction , said yesterday.\nThe potential damage may range from $15 billion to $18 billion, said Charles Watson, director of research and development at Kinetic Analysis Corp. , a hazard analysis firm in Silver Spring, Maryland .\n\u201cSince Sandy will be hitting during the workweek, there will be much greater secondary effects due to business interruption, power outages,\u201d Watson said in an e-mail interview.\nDamage Estimate\nCoreLogic Inc., which tracks real-estate information, said about 284,000 homes in seven states from Virginia to Massachusetts valued at almost $88 billion are at risk for storm surge damage.\nAt least 5,894 flights have been canceled through Oct. 30 as airlines reposition planes and crews, according to FlightAware, a Houston-based tracking company. Amtrak canceled most of its service in the Northeast starting at 7 p.m.\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo ordered the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to stop running New York City subways, buses and trains at 7 p.m. The transit system is the largest in the U.S., serving 8.5 million riders daily. Port Authority Trans-Hudson trains will close at 12:01 a.m. on Oct. 29.\nNew York City\u2019s schools will be closed tomorrow, Bloomberg said. The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP. New York electric utility Consolidated Edison Inc. (ED) will shut off underground power lines and transformers threatened by flooding, said Allen Drury, a company spokesman.\nCaribbean Impact\nThe system crossed Jamaica Oct. 24 and Cuba on Oct. 25, then tracked north across the central Bahamas. Most of the deaths in the Caribbean were in Haiti , still recovering from a devastating 2010 earthquake, the Associated Press reported.\nSandy is taking its unusual track into the East Coast because a number of weather systems have come together in just the right way, Uccellini said last week.\nHurricanes don\u2019t really move on their own and depend on other systems to pull or push them on their paths, Kines said.\nTo Sandy\u2019s east, a phenomenon called the North Atlantic Oscillation is acting like a closed door, barring the storm from moving in that direction. To the west, a cold front and another storm are creating a pattern that will pull Sandy toward them as it evolves into the superstorm some in the Weather Service have dubbed \u201cFrankenstorm.\u201d\nOn Alert\nNational Guard troops were put on alert in New York and other East Coast states to assist with the storm impact.\n\u201cBecause of the large size of the system and the slow motion, it\u2019s going to be a long-lasting event, two to three days of impacts for a lot of people,\u201d said James Franklin, branch chief at the hurricane center in Miami. \u201cThe kinds of things we are looking at ultimately would be wind damage, widespread power outages, heavy rainfall, inland flooding, and again, somebody is going to get a significant surge event out of this.\u201d\nUccellini said Sandy\u2019s winds will be felt as far from the coast as Ohio and Michigan, and the system could be comparable to 1991\u2019s so-called perfect storm. That nor\u2019easter eventually formed Hurricane Grace, and was chronicled in the best-selling book, \u201cThe Perfect Storm,\u201d by Sebastian Junger.\n\u201cI think was really is standing out for me is it is a huge footprint,\u201d said Mark Hoekzema, chief meteorologist at Earth Networks in Germantown, Maryland. \u201cWhat is impressive is that I have not seen a storm that will create the durations, frequency and intensity of wind over this amount of time.\u201d\nHigh Winds\nThe storm is expected to have near-hurricane-force winds as it approaches the mid-Atlantic coast tomorrow night, the Miami- based center said.\nSandy may dump as much as 12 inches of rain on parts of the Northeast, the agency said. The damage will be spread across a wider area than that left by a typical hurricane, according to Franklin.\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie ordered that the state\u2019s barrier islands and casinos in Atlantic City be evacuated by 4 p.m. today. The governor asked residents to pay heed to the warnings and \u201cbe prepared for the worst here.\u201d\nKroger Co. (KR) and Wal-Mart (WMT) Stores Inc. stocked their shelves with supplies. New York City hardware stores papered windows with signs urging passers-by to be prepared.\nPanic Buying\nWal-Mart is \u201cseeing a lot of panic buying in the Northeast,\u201d Dianna Gee, a spokeswoman for the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company, said by telephone. \u201cThe number one item people are coming for, and we are trying to restock as quickly as possible, is water.\u201d\nFranklin said the storm surge , in which ocean water is pushed ashore, will hit a larger area than Irene. The storm also will be striking two days after the full moon, when tides are at their highest.\nThe hurricane center said water may rise as much as 8 feet above ground with the storm surge from Ocean City, Maryland, to the Connecticut/Rhode Island line and in Long Island Sound and Raritan Bay.\nThe lunar high tides, along with ocean driven waves, may add about two feet to those estimates.\nNYC Surge\nIn a worst-case scenario, New York City may have a 10-foot surge, Kines said.\nThe hurricane center predicts as much as 3 feet of snow may fall in West Virginia and as much as 2 feet in the mountains of Virginia to Kentucky. As much as 12 to 18 inches may fall in the Appalachians in North Carolina and Tennessee.\nThe hurricane center\u2019s five-day outlook shows the system turning north over Pennsylvania at tropical-storm strength before weakening as it crosses into New York State, over Lake Ontario and into Canada.\nPower may be out as long as 10 days in some areas, according to a statement from the Edison Electric Institute , an industry trade group in Washington.\nThe hurricane center\u2019s web page no longer shows coastal storm watches and warnings on its tracking maps. Knabb said the agency decided to rely on regular weather watches and warnings, as opposed to hurricane advisories, to avoid confusion after the storm transitions into a more typical nor\u2019easter.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Brian K.

(DG) has risen 15 percent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really, really easy to see your stock price grow and your performance soar when you have no competitors,\u201d said Dutch Fox, a retail analyst with Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co. by phone from Arlington, Virginia.\nWhile retailers such as Canadian Tire Corp. face increased competition from Target\u2019s entry into Canada in 2013, the only firm with the potential to take on Dollarama is U.S. chain Dollar Tree Inc. which is at least five years from having the scale to compete, Perry Caicco, an analyst with CIBC World Markets, wrote in a Sept. 12 note.\n\u201cPeople realize Dollar Tree is coming, but they have to prove they can actually work in the Canadian space, and there\u2019s not a lot of retailers that have,\u201d Vanessa Morgan, president of Morgan, Meighen & Associates, which owns 365,000 Dollarama shares, or about 0.5 percent. Competition won\u2019t affect the share price any time soon, Morgan said by phone from Toronto.\nDollarama fell 7 Canadian cents to C$63.14 at the close in Toronto today, for a market value of C$4.66 billion ($4.73 billion). Wal-Mart fell 21 cents to $75.11 in New York and Target rose 80 cents to $63.92. The Standard & Poor\u2019s TSX Consumer Discretionary Index has risen 13 percent this year.\nDollar Giant\nChesapeake, Virginia-based Dollar Tree (DLTR) bought Dollar Giant Stores Ltd. in 2010 for C$52 million cash, giving it 85 Canadian locations. The company is in the preliminary stages of adding stores and building the infrastructure to sustain a national network, said Fox.\n\u201cDollar Tree right now is focusing on getting the acquisition integrated and realizing the immediately available synergies before they really start ramping up and rolling out,\u201d Fox said. Even if the company opens 75 stores a year it would be a few years before being able to \u201cdisrupt\u201d Dollarama, Fox said.\nDollar Tree will have about 1,000 stores in Canada, Chief Executive Officer Bob Sasser said in a conference call Oct. 11, without giving a time frame. Calls and e-mails yesterday to Tim Reid, a Dollar Tree spokesman, were not returned.\nGrowth Potential\nLyla Radmanovich, a spokeswoman for Dollarama, declined to comment.\nDollarama has more stores than its competitors combined, said Neil Linsdell, an analyst at Industrial Alliance Securities Inc. With plans to open 50-60 stores a year for an eventual total of 1,000, it has plenty of room to grow in a Canadian market that could sustain as many as 2,400 dollar stores, he said. On average, the top six dollar store chains in Canada serve 28,500 people per store, compared with 14,000 people per store among the top five U.S. chains, he said.\n\u201cWhen the market was really open to that type of offering, Dollarama was really the first one to jump in with scale, with speed, and basically just completely dominates the market,\u201d Linsdell said by phone from Montreal .\nDollarama\u2019s specialization in items that can be bought for pocket change also blunts competition with mass retailers like Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, which has experimented with dollar offerings, but for the most part sells higher priced goods, Linsdell said.\n\u201cWe have many items across our stores that sell for $1,\u201d said Andrew Pelletier, a spokesman for Wal-Mart. \u201cIt\u2019s not limited to a program or a particular zone of the store. We work with our suppliers to offer great items throughout our stores for $1.\u201d\nMore Traffic\nSlower economic growth in Canada, which is forecast in a Bloomberg survey to be 2 percent next year after 2.6 percent in 2011, make Dollarama\u2019s prices appealing. Its focus on small- ticket, convenience items such as napkins and pens has immunized the chain from shifts to online and cross-border shopping, Caicco at CIBC said in his note.\nFor the same reason, Dollarama needn\u2019t be concerned about the arrival of Minneapolis-based Target next year, Jim Durran, an analyst with Barclays Plc, wrote in a note Oct. 1. Dollarama will benefit from increased traffic when a Target opens nearby, he said.\nThe company\u2019s introduction of debit payment and items priced above a dollar helped boost sales in recent quarters, said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. by phone from St. Louis, Missouri . Those improvements mean large year-over-year sales increases are unlikely in the future, even with the five-year window before competition ramps up, he said.\nSales Moderate\nYarbrough, who rates the stock hold, said when Dollarama\u2019s sales figures start to moderate, disappointed investors might send the stock down. Ten analysts say buy the stock, four say hold it and no one says sell it, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u201cWhen you look at analysts\u2019 numbers and all these guys with buys, to justify upside in the stock they all have operating margin targets and same store sales growing much higher than the company said they\u2019re comfortable with,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of two things is going to happen: The company is going to attain those targets, or at some point it settles in that they can\u2019t hit 18 and 19 percent operating margins and the company gets a little weaker.\u201d\nEarnings Beat\nDollarama is estimated to report earnings of 70 Canadian cents a share, adjusted for certain items in the third quarter, after beating the average of analysts\u2019 estimates in Bloomberg surveys for at least the past five quarters. Dollarama\u2019s revenue grew 14 percent to C$441 million in the second quarter from a year earlier. Profit climbed to C$49.8 million or 66 cents a share, adjusted.\nDollarama has also posted higher sales per store and sales per square foot compared with three of its four U.S. peers, and similar outperformance on same-store sales, a key retail metric that discounts newly opened and recently closed stores, CIBC World Market\u2019s Caicco said in his note.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ari Altstedter in Toronto at aaltstedter@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Scanlan at dscanlan@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "MEXBOL", "embersId": "2c4213de7e2dc401f0dabf033eda3a8da92a7569"}]}
