The shares have gained 31 percent this year, beating a 15 percent return by the benchmark Colcap Index.\nRising spending on protection for its pipelines and fields from guerrilla attacks and declining sales volumes led Ecopetrol\u2019s profit to fall. Net income slid 22 percent from a year earlier to 3.23 trillion pesos ($1.76 billion), the Bogota- based company said yesterday after markets closed.\nSales volumes for Ecopetrol, the world\u2019s seventh-largest oil firm by market capitalization, fell after delays in environmental permits for production and transportation disruptions in July and August. Costs also rose because of maintenance at a refinery in Santander province and a one-time adjustment to an oilfield investment in the year-earlier period, according to a company filing yesterday.\nEcopetrol may cut its annual production goal as it will be \u201cvirtually impossible to achieve\u201d after this quarter, Juan David Pineros, a Medellin-based analyst at Interbolsa SA, said in a report today. Permit delays and transport interruptions may continue into the first half of 2013, Pineros said.\nRising Output\nProduction climbed 1.6 percent from a year earlier to 743,100 barrels a day. Ecopetrol last cut its output forecast in July to 780,000 barrels a day from 800,000 barrels a day for the year after guerrillas increased attacks on oil infrastructure.\nEcopetrol will meet its target as production is projected to increase in many of its fields, Chief Executive Officer Javier Gutierrez said today in a conference call with analysts. A Cupiagua field project will add 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, he said.\nThe company estimates lost output of around 35,000 barrels a day so far this year, including impact from sabotage and government permit delays, he said. Attacks on oil pipelines in the Andean nation rose to 117 in the first 8 months of the year, from 21 in the same period in 2011, according to government figures.\nAttacks on Ecopetrol\u2019s installations \u201csignificantly\u201d declined in October, Gutierrez said.\nThe government won\u2019t present a bill to Congress this year to allow it to sell a stake in Ecopetrol, Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas said in an interview last month. The Colombian government owns an 88.5 percent stake in Ecopetrol.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Christine Jenkins in Bogota at cjenkins28@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "COLCAP", "embersId": "03e99501a79e4fbfd9a03bcef944dcb0de99ce3e"}], "CRSMBCT": [{"postTime": "2012-10-31 11:30:25", "postDate": "2012-10-31", "author": "Gordana Filipovic", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-31/serbia-to-sell-2-billion-eurobond-to-fund-debt-dinkic-says-1-.html", "title": "Serbia to Sell $2 Billion Eurobond to Fund Debt, Dinkic Says", "updateTime": "2012-10-31 15:36:33", "content": "Serbia to Sell $2 Billion Eurobond to Fund Debt, Dinkic Says\nBy Gordana Filipovic - 2012-10-31T15:30:25Z\nSerbia will sell $2 billion in Eurobonds next year to finance its debt and wants to open its banking market to new investors from Russia and the Middle East to pull it out of a recession, Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic said.\n\u201cWe will start a road show next week in the United States and London ,\u201d home to a majority of the investors who snapped up Serbia\u2019s September Eurobond issue, Dinkic said in an interview in Belgrade today, adding that some demand \u201cthis time may also come from Asian markets.\u201d\nThe transaction is planned for next spring, after Serbia concludes a new loan deal with the International Monetary Fund. Advisers include Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and for the first time Russia\u2019s VTB Bank OJSC (VTBR) , and \u201cthey will be also looking into possible issues of a Samurai or Russian ruble debt,\u201d Dinkic said.\nThe Cabinet of Prime Minister Ivica Dacic, which took office on July 27, has taken measures to avoid bankruptcy after the fiscal gap reached 7.1 percent of gross domestic product and public debt reached almost 55 percent of GDP in June with the economy mired in its second recession in three years.\nThe new Eurobond will come after the government tests the market with a $500 million issue of 5-year debt in November, when it hopes to further lower the cost of borrowing \u201cand set a new benchmark,\u201d Dinkic said. Serbia raised $1 billion in September with yields at 6.625 percent and Dinkic expects yields to be \u201cway below 6 percent\u201d next month.\nRussia, IMF\nThe government is still counting on a $1 billion loan from Russia to help support its budget next year as the funds are cheaper than what Serbia pays for its Eurobonds.\n\u201cThe aim of the government is to keep on reducing the cost of borrowing alongside fiscal consolidation and structural reforms,\u201d he said. The reforms will be discussed with the IMF in November and the size of a new loan in January or February. \u201cWe would like a program best suited for a medium-term\u201d because reforms are much easier with the IMF, he said.\nSerbia will try to divest its stake in local banks and keep on talking with \u201ccarmakers from Germany\u201d as well as China and India for investments, Dinkic said. The government will also try to sell Telekom Srbija AD again next year if it gets a right price \u201cof around 2.5 billion euros ($3.2 billion) for the 100 percent stake,\u201d he said. Revenues will help lower the public debt, he said.\nCars, Bank Sales\nInvestments are crucial to generate growth of at least 2 percent next year, with Serbia still keen to expand the car industry \u201cdespite the difficult situation in the global car market.\u201d The central bank is more optimistic forecasting an export and investment-led expansion of 3 percent in 2013.\nAsset sales will start in November this year, with the government calling a tender for the sale of its 65 percent stake in Privredna Banka Beograd AD (PRBN) , one of several troubled banks that the state will no longer support, he said. Another bank for sale is Srpska Banka AD (SRBN) and \u201ctalks are under way with Gazprombank OJSC (GZPR*) , VTB Bank and a bank from Abu Dhabi.\u201d\nAbu Dhabi investors are looking into Serbia\u2019s agriculture, property, weapons industry and banking market and may even get a \u201cgreenfield banking license,\u201d he said, adding that the implementation of some transactions may begin as early as the second quarter of 2013.\nSerbia\u2019s biggest bank, Komercijalna Banka AD (KMBN) , where the government added 100 million euros this week to keep its stake in the bank, will not be for sale \u201cbecause of unfavorable market conditions,\u201d Dinkic said.\nInstead, the bank co-owned by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the IFC Capitalization (Equity) Fund, Sweden \u2019s Swedfund International AB and Germany \u2019s Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklunggesellschaft mbH, known as DEG, may be listed \u201cin a foreign stock exchange in the medium term with a free-float of 20 percent, with 10 percent each coming from the stake held by the government and the EBRD and IFC, so that the ownership balance remains unchanged,\u201d he said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Gordana Filipovic in Belgrade at gfilipovic@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James M.

The German unit priced 258.8 million shares at 5.60 euros each, compared with an original range of 5.25 euros to 6.50 euros. The stock climbed as much as 2.9 percent to 5.76 euros on the Frankfurt exchange today.\nRussian wireless carrier OAO Megafon postponed marketing its IPO this month amid a global slowdown in the equity markets. Telefonica, which has net debt of more than 58 billion euros, is considering sharing its mobile phone network in Germany with Royal KPN NV\u2019s local E-Plus division to lower costs, Telefonica Deutschland told investors on a call about the IPO last week.\n\u201cTelefonica Deutschland\u2019s dividend yield is almost 8 percent, which is slightly above the rest of the industry in Europe ,\u201d according to Francisco Salvador, a Madrid-based strategist at FGA/MG Valores. \u201cThat, combined with more earnings growth potential compared to its peers,\u201d may be the primary reasons why Telefonica has successfully carried out the IPO, he said.\nShares of Madrid-based Telefonica dropped 1.3 percent to 10.07 euros yesterday. They have dropped 25 percent this year, compared with a 10 percent decline in the benchmark IBEX 35 index. The Germany unit\u2019s IPO is the biggest in that country since engine-maker Tognum AG raised 1.8 billion euros in 2007.\nLow Price\n\u201cTelefonica has sought to secure the transaction at a low price in order to make it more attractive to investors, as it really needs to raise the cash,\u201d said Adrian Zunzunegui, a Madrid-based analyst at Credit Agricole Cheuvreux.\nTelefonica\u2019s deteriorating cash flow and lower earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will continue even after the IPO, Zunzunegui said. The company is Europe\u2019s most indebted phone operator.\n\u201cWhen people were looking at a potential coming together of Telefonica Deutschland and E-Plus, there was some significant analysis of potential network synergies,\u201d Rachel Empey, chief financial officer of Telefonica Deutschland, told investors on a conference call last week. \u201cQuite a lot of those synergies might be available through network sharing.\u201d\nE-Plus\nA hypothetical merger of Telefonica Deutschland and E-Plus could generate synergies worth about 4 billion euros for the companies, according to a document prepared by one of the banks managing the IPO and obtained by Bloomberg News. KPN said last year that such a deal may generate 3 billion euros of synergies.\nTelefonica Deutschland vies with E-Plus for the position of the third-largest wireless company in Germany , where Vodafone Group Plc and Deutsche Telekom AG are the leaders.\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service has given Telefonica a long-term debt rating of Baa2, the second-lowest investment grade, with a negative outlook. Standard & Poor\u2019s said this month that it may reduce Telefonica\u2019s BBB rating, the equivalent of Moody\u2019s, citing the company\u2019s exposure to Spain\u2019s sovereign-debt risks.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see the equity story after the deal, unless Telefonica achieves a network-sharing agreement with KPN,\u201d Peter Braendle, who helps manage about $55 billion at the Zurich-based Swisscanto Asset Management, said in a phone interview. Braendle said he hadn\u2019t subscribed to any shares in the IPO.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Manuel Baigorri in Madrid at Mbaigorri@bloomberg.net ; Ruth David in London at rdavid9@bloomberg.net ; Aaron Kirchfeld in London at akirchfeld@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jacqueline Simmons at jackiem@bloomberg.net ;\nTelefonica Germany Unit Prices IPO as Investors Bet on KPN Gains\nTelefonica Germany GmbH & Co. via Bloomberg\nMobile phone handsets are displayed inside an O2 mobile phone store, operated by Telefonica Germany GmbH & Co., in Munich.\nMobile phone handsets are displayed inside an O2 mobile phone store, operated by Telefonica Germany GmbH & Co., in Munich.

The London- based lender is scheduled to report earnings at 7 a.m. tomorrow.\nThe results will be the first for Antony Jenkins , who took over as chief executive officer in August after Barclays was fined a record 290 million pounds for manipulating Libor. He\u2019s benefited from a rebound in fixed-income markets triggered by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi\u2019s July pledge to defend the euro with \u201cwhatever it takes.\u201d The spread between Spanish and German 10-year bond yields has since narrowed by more than a percentage point.\n\u201cFixed income, currency and commodities was the strong component of the third quarter so far for other banks, so all eyes will be on the strength of that line for Barclays,\u201d said Vivek Raja, an analyst at Oriel Securities Ltd. in London. He rates Barclays a hold.\nA Barclays spokesman declined to comment. The shares have risen 42 percent in London trading in the second half, for the second-best performance in the Bloomberg European Banks Index (BEBANKS) , which has gained 15 percent.\nFICC Revenue\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s so-called FICC revenue climbed 28 percent from a year earlier and was up 1 percent from the second quarter, according to figures released two weeks ago. JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s fixed-income trading revenue excluding accounting adjustments rose 33 percent in the third quarter, while Citigroup Inc.\u2019s increased 63 percent.\nBarclays\u2019s FICC revenue may rise 20 percent to 1.99 billion pounds from 1.66 billion pounds for the third quarter, Credit Suisse Group AG analysts led by Amit Goel said in a note to clients on Oct. 23. That could push investment-banking revenue 23 percent higher to 2.9 billion pounds, Goel wrote. In the first six months of 2012, FICC accounted for more than half of revenue at Barclays\u2019s corporate and investment banking unit, which in turn generates about half the lender\u2019s total revenue.\nThose gains will be eroded by provisions for compensation to clients who were wrongly sold insurance on loan repayments as well as an accounting adjustment on the fair value of Barclays\u2019s debt. So-called credit valuation adjustments require banks to book losses when the value of their debt rises, and gains when it declines, on the theory that a loss, or profit, would be realized were the bank to repurchase that debt.\nNet Loss\nBarclays will probably post a net loss of 229 million pounds for the quarter, according to Christopher Wheeler, a banking analyst at Mediobanca SpA in London , compared with net income of 1.15 billion pounds a year earlier.\nBarclays said on Oct. 18 that it will set aside an extra 700 million pounds to compensate clients wrongly sold payment- protection insurance, weeks after Jenkins, the bank\u2019s former consumer-banking head, became CEO. That provision is on top of the 300 million-pound charge in the first quarter. The charge brings the total Barclays has set aside to compensate customers who were sold the insurance on loans unnecessarily or without their knowledge to 2 billion pounds.\nPretax third-quarter profit, excluding the PPI provision and a charge of 1.1 billion pounds of swings in the value of its own debt, would still be in line with analysts\u2019 estimates of about 1.7 billion pounds, Barclays said on Oct. 18.\nRich Ricci\nRich Ricci, who became the sole leader of the securities unit in June, this month combined part of the fixed-income and equities operations in his first reorganization since taking sole control of investment banking in June. Ricci helped build the investment bank as the lieutenant of former CEO Robert Diamond, who left in July in the wake of the Libor fine.\nThe lender is cutting just under 10 percent of staff in its equities division in Europe , Middle East and Africa to reduce costs amid a slump in trading volumes, people with knowledge of the matter said on Oct. 19. Securities firms from Milan-based UniCredit SpA to Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc. are also shrinking equity businesses in Europe as trading volumes fall and profitability decreases.\nOriel\u2019s Raja said Barclays is likely to see less of a bounce from fixed income than some of its U.S. peers, such as Citigroup and JPMorgan, given its asset holdings are less risky.\n\u201cThe market is probably aware enough by now that Barclays\u2019s investment bank\u2019s low inventory risk probably means they\u2019ll underperform slightly this quarter, but that\u2019s no bad thing as the income is less volatile,\u201d Raja said.\nCorporate Bonds\nSeptember was the busiest month for sales of corporate bonds since the euro crisis began, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Barclays ranked seventh for corporate bond underwriting in the third quarter, with 3.8 percent market share and $37.6 billion of sales, according to Bloomberg data.\n\u201cThe upside will be in strong FICC and the steady-as-she goes will be in retail and commercial banking,\u201d said Sandy Chen, an analyst at Cenkos Securities in London. \u201cThe question mark is whether there are other provisions, perhaps for Libor litigation.\u201d\nThe lender face class-action lawsuits after regulators found it manipulated the London interbank offered rate, the benchmark for more than $300 trillion of securities worldwide.\nJenkins will still also have to deal with a criminal probe by the U.K. Serious Fraud Office, which prosecutes bribery and white-collar crime, into fees the bank paid in 2008 to Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund as the lender sought to raise money to avoid a government bailout.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Howard Mustoe in London at hmustoe@bloomberg.net .\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Edward Evans at eevans3@bloomberg.net\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "CRSMBCT", "embersId": "530a1130297fde07d1eb2f8fb2f386ad9878f61a"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-29 20:00:01", "postDate": "2012-10-29", "author": "Jennifer Ryan", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-30/boe-s-haldane-tells-occupy-libor-furor-prompted-change.html", "title": "BOE\u2019s Haldane Tells Occupy Libor Furor Prompted Change", "updateTime": "2012-10-31 15:36:37", "content": "BOE\u2019s Haldane Tells Occupy Libor Furor Prompted Change\nBy Jennifer Ryan - 2012-10-30T00:00:01Z\nBank of England official Andrew Haldane told the Occupy group that the Libor scandal has prompted real change by stoking an impetus for banking reform.\n\u201cI think things then just changed,\u201d he said at an event organized by the group in London yesterday. \u201cThat for me was the  straw that delivered real change.\u201d\nHaldane, executive director for financial stability and a member of the central bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, spoke after telling Occupy that its protests centered on St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral in London\u2019s financial district had not been in vain. They helped prompt a \u201creformation of finance\u201d that is in its early stages, and proposals to change banking may amount to the biggest change since the 1930s, he said.\n\u201cThis crisis will scar a generation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will keep on coming back. That will provide a durability to the reforms I just mentioned.\u201d\nHaldane spoke at an event organized by Occupy Economics called \u201cSocially Useful Banking.\u201d He introduced his speech by noting that the chief executive officers of Barclays Plc (BARC) and Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) have recently said banks need to \u201crediscover their social usefulness.\u201d\nBarclays was fined a record 290 million pounds ($465 million) in June for attempting to manipulate Libor. The fine, coupled with criticism from regulators, triggered the resignations of Diamond, Chairman Marcus Agius and Chief Operating Officer Jerry del Missier. Other firms are still being probed over alleged rate-rigging.\nOccupy\u2019s Success\n\u201cOccupy has been successful in its efforts to popularize the problems of the global financial system for one very simple reason: they are right,\u201d Haldane said.\nPolice evicted the last Occupy London campaigners from Finsbury Square in June, eight months after the income inequality demonstrations began in the U.K. capital at St. Paul\u2019s, where protesters had already been removed.\nIn his speech, Haldane said that financial institutions might need to split in two if ring-fencing of retail and investment bank operations as proposed by John Vickers fails to change their culture. The plan by Vickers, a potential candidate for Bank of England governor, has similar aims to those of the U.S.\u2019s Volcker rule and a European blueprint suggested by Bank of Finland Governor Erkki Liikanen.\n\u201cCan two separate sub-cultures really operate underneath a single roof? Time will tell,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it is not possible, then full separation would be the logical next step. Alternatively, banks themselves might of course voluntarily choose to divest and separate, as some are already doing.\u201d\nAcid Test\nHe said that cultural separation should be an \u201cacid test\u201d of success of any plans to change the banking industry.\n\u201cThe culture and practices of investment banking infiltrated retail banking -- a sales culture which culminated in harmful cross-selling and unlawful mis-selling,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are successful, these structural reform efforts will reverse this pattern.\u201d\nHaldane listed culture among five areas beginning with \u201cC\u201d where banking needs to change. The others are capital, compensation, credit and competition. On the latter, he said that everyone can play their part.\n\u201cIf as bank customers we want to change the culture of banking, then we should start by supporting those banks who are delivering that change,\u201d he said. \u201cPutting your money where your mouth is would deliver far greater and more durable change than any amount of banker bashing.\u201d\nSwedish Model\nLenders such as Svenska Handelsbanken AB, whose expansion in the U.K. may make it one of the country\u2019s fastest-growing banks, is gaining customers by making credit decisions locally and eschewing bonuses in favor of a shared fund pooled annually, Haldane said. A preference for banks with a culture of focus on basic banking services can help address the problem of a lack of competition in lending, which fed the financial crisis.\n\u201cWe need to raise our levels of ambition when breaking down barriers to entry into banking, to ensure bank customers get a fair and efficient deal,\u201d he said. Proposals that store customer account details in a shared utility could facilitate transfer between banks, as it may with gas and mobile phone providers, he said.\nOn compensation, Haldane noted a \u201cdeeply-rooted problem of short-termism,\u201d in capital markets.\n\u201cAltering the time horizon for pay would be a good starting point,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, some banks now use a remuneration model based on \u2018deferral until retirement.\u2019 It would be fantastic if that caught on.\u201d\nHaldane said that there is now a particular impetus to prove to investors that financial centers are secure.\n\u201cWhat you see these days with people very nervous, very panicky, very uncertain,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they want first and foremost is a safe financial system. Financial centers are going out of their way to show that they are safe and sound.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jennifer Ryan in London at jryan13@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Craig Stirling at cstirling1@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "CRSMBCT", "embersId": "b9fc458c0786ba435acaa3485cd88d419f879c95"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-29 18:01:00", "postDate": "2012-10-29", "author": "Sibel Akbay", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-29/turkish-banks-go-for-gold-to-lure-302-billion-hoard.html", "title": "Turkish Banks Go for Gold to Lure $302 Billion Hoard", "updateTime": "2012-10-31 15:36:38", "content": "Turkish Banks Go for Gold to Lure $302 Billion Hoard\nBy Sibel Akbay - 2012-10-29T22:01:00Z\nDeniz Kalkan, a 32-year-old housewife in Istanbul, is ready to move her gold.\n\u201cI\u2019ll put these in a deposit account as soon as I get the time,\u201d Kalkan said of the half-dozen gold coins she has collected and stashed in her apartment. \u201cIt\u2019s much safer to keep them in the bank than at home.\u201d\nWhen Kalkan brings in her coins, she\u2019ll be joining a wave of Turks responding to a drive to lure an estimated $302 billion of hidden gold into the economy to help ease the nation\u2019s current-account deficit , the world\u2019s biggest after the U.S. Gold-based deposit accounts surged 15 percent this year through the end of July, three times the increase in standard savings accounts, according to the central bank .\nThe gold accounts give customers an amount in Turkish lira equivalent to the weight of the precious metal they turn over to the bank. They can then withdraw cash or take out loans, while the lender is able to sell or hold onto the gold.\nAt Yapi Kredi Bankasi AS (YKBNK) , owned by UniCredit SpA (UCG) and Koc Holding AS (KCHOL) , deposits in gold-based mutual funds, which invest at least 51 percent of their money in precious metals and offer a guaranteed return on capital, increased 62 percent in 2012. Turkiye Is Bankasi AS (ISCTR) , Turkey \u2019s largest bank by assets, said gold deposits increased 10-fold in the two years through June.\nThe campaign by Turkey\u2019s banks, featuring ads for \u201cgolden age\u201d accounts and products such as gold gift checks, is targeted at Turks who traditionally give gold coins or jewelry as presents at weddings, births and circumcision ceremonies. The custom gained popularity a decade ago as Turkey\u2019s inflation rate topped 70 percent, making gold an attractive store of wealth.\nIrish GDP\nBy bringing some of what the World Gold Council estimates are 5,000 metric tons (5,512 tons) of treasure into the banking system -- an amount greater in value than Ireland\u2019s gross domestic product -- Turkey hopes to reduce gold imports and external borrowing, according to Erdal Aral, deputy chief executive officer of Isbank.\n\u201cWe have to get the gold that\u2019s out there into the financial system,\u201d Aral said in an interview in Istanbul this month. \u201cThis is going to be an important step toward solving our current-account problem.\u201d\nTurkey\u2019s current-account deficit, the amount its imports exceeded exports, peaked at $77 billion in 2011. The gap narrowed by 23 percent this year to $59 billion at the end of August on a 12-month rolling basis as record gold sales by Turkish companies to the United Arab Emirates and Iran pushed up exports, according to the government\u2019s statistics office.\nExporting Gold\nImports shrank at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in August, while exports rose 14.5 percent, driven primarily by gold. Sales of precious metals to the UAE and Iran, which is grappling with trade sanctions, jumped to $9.2 billion this year through August from $645 million a year earlier, statistics office data show.\n\u201cGold exports to Iran and UAE are helping Turkey to improve its current-account gap quicker than expected,\u201d Ozgur Altug , chief economist at Istanbul-based brokerage BGC Partners, said in an e-mail.\nTurkey doesn\u2019t produce enough gold to account for its exports. Production this year through August was about 25 metric tons, according to data from the Gold Miners Association. Gold imports were 109 tons as of the end of September, the Istanbul Gold Exchange said on its website.\n\u201cThe gold has to come from somewhere so that it can be exported,\u201d Altug said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious the gold under the mattress is fast entering the system.\u201d\nHousehold Savings\nThe effort to lure gold into banks also will increase household savings, the lowest among emerging markets . Turkey\u2019s savings rate is 12.7 percent compared with China \u2019s 53 percent, according to a World Bank report . Raising the savings rate will reduce the amount banks have to borrow to fund their lending and enable them to make more loans.\n\u201cWe support the government\u2019s drive to increase savings,\u201d Galip Tozge, executive vice president for consumer banking at Istanbul-based Akbank TAS (AKBNK) , part-owned by Citigroup Inc. (C) , said in an interview. \u201cGold accounts will play an important role in this, as unregistered assets will come into the system.\u201d\nThe rise in gold prices in recent years added to the metal\u2019s popularity. Spot gold, which traded at $1,711.38 an ounce on Oct. 29, has climbed 9 percent this year, heading for a 12th consecutive annual gain, as investors bought bullion to protect against inflation.\nTurkish women began holding \u201cgolden days,\u201d when a gift, in the form of coins or jewelry, was brought to the hostess of a party. That\u2019s how Kalkan accumulated her small hoard, she said.\n\u2018It\u2019s Profitable\u2019\n\u201cI buy gold every month, usually in the form of jewelry,\u201d said Ozlem Basar, a 26-year-old Istanbul shipping-company executive. \u201cIt\u2019s profitable, as prices are rising fast and inflation\u2019s increasing.\u201d\nTurkey\u2019s inflation accelerated to 9.2 percent in September, climbing to a five-month high, almost double the central bank\u2019s year-end target of 5 percent. GDP growth fell to 2.9 percent in the second quarter from 9.1 percent a year earlier.\nBanks are competing to attract gold with a variety of products. Isbank and Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , the country\u2019s biggest lender by market value, offer gold-backed loans, where customers can bring jewelry or coins to the bank and take out loans against their value. Garanti also has a credit card linked to gold deposit accounts. The bank said it soon will enable customers to withdraw their savings in gold, instead of Turkish lira or foreign exchange.\n\u2018Golden Days\u2019\nIslamic Asya Katilim Bankasi AS (ASYAB) has hosted its own \u201cgolden days,\u201d when customers bring in coins and jewelry to be evaluated by experts. The Istanbul-based lender said it collected three metric tons of bullion through such promotions since March 2012 and that gold accounts have climbed 22 percent this year through July.\nHSBC Holding Plc\u2019s (HSBA) Turkish unit is promoting a gold-based mutual fund on its website with the slogan, \u201cLet the fund you touch turn to gold.\u201d\nWhile Indian banks offer some instruments linked to gold to discourage hoarding, the choices are not as varied as those in Turkey, according to Isbank\u2019s Aral.\n\u201cTurkey seems to be trying the hardest to get the stashed gold into the system,\u201d he said.\nGovernment measures, including an Aug. 16 central bank decision to raise the proportion of reserves lenders can keep in gold to 30 percent from 25 percent, have encouraged efforts to attract more bullion, Aral said. Central bank Governor Erdem Basci has said he may make adjusting the ratio his main monetary policy tool.\nGrand Bazaar\nBanks will have to diversify their services further for customers to find keeping gold in the bank attractive, Gokhan Ceviker, senior vice president for retail management at Bank Asya, said in an interview.\nTo speed up diversification, Turkey\u2019s regulators have been discussing planned legislation to enable customers to buy or sell gold at bank branches or transfer gold into other accounts, according to an Aug. 29 report in Milliyet , a daily newspaper. Bank Asya has said it will soon start purchasing and selling bullion at its branches.\nTurkey\u2019s jewelers, many of them located in Istanbul\u2019s Grand Bazaar, one of the world\u2019s largest covered markets, have opposed the move. They say banks buying and selling gold would cut their revenue and push them into underground trading.\n\u201cI always viewed gold deposit accounts positively because the funds will return to our industry as loans,\u201d Kamil Karakas, chairman of gold producer Karakas Atlantis Kiymetli Madenler AS (KRATL) , said in an interview. \u201cBut banks buying and selling gold is a serious blow for jewelers.\u201d\nChanging Habits\nThe plan will fail as banks won\u2019t be able to replicate the trust between the jeweler and the customer, said Faruk Bektas, a spokesman for the Grand Bazaar Tradespeople Association, which represents jewelers.\nThe six-century-old Grand Bazaar is host to almost 4,000 jewelers, and about 1.5 metric tons of scrap gold is processed into bullion there every day, according to Istanbul Gold Exchange data. Transaction volume totaled 8.5 billion liras ($4.7 billion) last year.\n\u201cIt will take a while for tradition to break, but habits will eventually change,\u201d Bank Asya\u2019s Ceviker said. \u201cMore and more people will see banks as the place to take their gold. These new resources will help us fund more loans, which will help the Turkish economy to grow.\u201d\nEditors: Robert Friedman, Dale Crofts\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Sibel Akbay in Istanbul at sakbay@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Dale Crofts at dcrofts@bloomberg.net\nTurkish Banks Go for Gold in Drive to Lure $302 Billion Hoard\nKerem Uzel/Bloomberg\nGold trinkets sit on display at a jewelry store in the Grand Bazaar's gold souk in Istanbul.\nGold trinkets sit on display at a jewelry store in the Grand Bazaar's gold souk in Istanbul.

The predecessor, KPS Special Situations Fund III, originally gathered $1.2 billion in 2007 before accepting an additional $800 million two years later to take advantage of what the firm called \u201cunprecedented\u201d opportunities arising from the global financial crisis.\nDaniel Yunger, a spokesman at Kekst & Co., declined to comment on behalf of KPS.\nKPS, based in New York , makes control investments in special situations including corporate divestitures and carve- outs, turnarounds, bankruptcies, financial restructurings and out-of-favor industries, according to its website. The firm, which primarily targets manufacturing companies, will consider all industries except technology, financial services, telecommunications, broadcast media, real estate and natural resources.\nKPS typically invests $50 million to $300 million in deals as large as $1 billion. It targets companies with revenues of at least $400 million, according to the website.\nFund Returns\nThe firm can point to recent exits. This month it agreed to sell North American Breweries Holdings LLC to Florida Ice & Farm Co. SA\u2019s Cerveceria Costa Rica for $388 million. It also sold HHI Group Holdings LLC, a maker of components for automotive customers, to American Securities LLC for undisclosed terms.\nThe prior fund was producing a 1.7 multiple and a 21 percent net internal rate of return as of March 31, according to performance data from California Public Employees Retirement System.\nFounded in 1997, KPS has four investment partners: Psaros, David Shapiro , Raquel Palmer and Jay Bernstein.

(HOLN) , plans to boost capacity to 12 million tons a year by 2015 from 8.3 million tons as housing construction increases and the government works on more infrastructure projects, President Director Eamon Ginley said.\n\u201cThe cement industry here in terms of domestic supply needs to double because the market will grow to nearly 100 million tons by 2020-2021,\u201d Ginley, 46, said in an interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in south Jakarta. \u201cThe prospects for the cement industry are very strong.\u201d\nIndonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has pledged to build more highways, airports and ports to clear bottlenecks and meet an economic growth target of an average 6.6 percent by the end of his second term in 2014. Gross domestic product expanded 6.37 percent in the second quarter. Bank Indonesia (BBRI) reiterated its forecast last month for expansion at 6.1 percent to 6.5 percent this year and 6.3 percent to 6.7 percent in 2013.\nHolcim Indonesia is spending $450 million to build the first Tuban plant, which will have an annual capacity of 1.7 million tons when it begins operation next year, Ginley said. The second facility will have \u201csimilar\u201d capacity, he said.\nHolcim operates two sites on Java island and a cement grinding station in Banten province, west of Jakarta. If the second plant in Tuban is approved, the company would have total capacity of almost 12 million tons by 2015, Ginley said.\nOutlook\n\u201cIf Holcim wants to remain competitive with the other two listed cement companies, it better expand its capacity again,\u201d said Adolf Sutrisno, an analyst at Andalan Artha Advisindo Sekuritas in Singapore . \u201cThe outlook for the cement industry is very good as it will be supported by the government\u2019s infrastructure spending.\u201d\nIndonesian cement companies have outperformed the broader market this year and Holcim is the best-performing stock among three listed cement makers. Its share price has gained 49 percent in 2012, better than the 30 percent increase of PT Semen Gresik (SMGR) and 26 percent gain of PT Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa. (INTP) The Jakarta Composite index has risen 14 percent.\nBetter Margins\nGinley predicted a margin on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of 30 percent to 35 percent over the next five years as better efficiency from the facility in Tuban helps lower the operating costs and reduces transportation costs to areas in East Java. The margin in the first half fell to 25.7 percent from 28.7 percent a year earlier.\nThe Tuban plant \u201cgives us position in the East Java market,\u201d Ginley said. \u201cWe truck the cement from the West Java or Central Java plants to supply East Java today. Next year, when we turn on the Tuban plant, we can save all those additional logistic costs.\u201d\nIndonesia consumed 48 million tons of cement last year, industry data show, and Ginley expects the volume to expand by 14 percent this year and at least 10 percent in 2013.\nIndonesia has a \u201cvery solid plan\u201d to boost economic growth, Ginley said. \u201cIn order to do this, you need cement. If you don\u2019t have cement, you can\u2019t have development. That\u2019s why it\u2019s very important for Indonesia that the local industry also continues to invest and meet this challenge.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Harry Suhartono in Jakarta at hsuhartono@bloomberg.net ; Fitri Wulandari in Jakarta at fwulandari@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Darren Boey at dboey@bloomberg.net ; Greg Ahlstrand at gahlstrand@bloomberg.net\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "CRSMBCT", "embersId": "66767d96f2fa4cef47d61c616831090d42b3e1e3"}], "IBVC": [{"postTime": "2012-10-31 13:19:26", "postDate": "2012-10-31", "author": "Charles Penty", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-31/bbva-s-quarterly-profit-slumps-as-real-estate-purge-continues.html", "title": "BBVA Quarterly Profit Slumps Amid Real Estate Cleanup", "updateTime": "2012-10-31 15:37:06", "content": "BBVA Quarterly Profit Slumps Amid Real Estate Cleanup\nBy Charles Penty - 2012-10-31T17:19:26Z\nBanco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , Spain\u2019s second-biggest bank, said third-quarter profit fell 82 percent as it continued to purge soured real estate assets.\nNet income dropped to 146 million euros ($190 million) from 804 million euros in the year-earlier period, the Bilbao, Spain- based bank said in a filing today. That missed the average 186.4 million-euro estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 11 analysts.\nBBVA said it has completed two-thirds of the provisioning charges needed to comply with government orders to Spanish banks to recognize losses on real estate that piled up on their balance sheets after the property market crashed. Higher profit from Mexico and South America helped to cushion a 532 million- euro nine-month loss from Spain, which still accounts for about 60 percent of BBVA\u2019s lending.\n\u201cI liked the results from Spain on an operational level and if they\u2019d been better from Mexico you could have said they would have been very good earnings,\u201d said Juan Pablo Lopez, an analyst at Espirito Santo Investment Bank in Madrid .\nBBVA closed 1.8 percent higher in Madrid trading at 6.44 euros, paring this year\u2019s decline to 3.6 percent. That compares with a 15 percent gain for the 38-member Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index. Larger Spanish rival Banco Santander SA (SAN) , which reported a 94 percent drop in quarterly profit on Oct. 25, has declined 1.4 percent this year.\nDividend Policy\nGreater clarity on the outlook for earnings as uncertainty over its real estate loan book diminishes may allow the bank to \u201ctake decisions\u201d over the dividend in future, BBVA President and Chief Operating Officer Angel Cano said on a webcast today.\nHe said the bank doesn\u2019t have reason to change its dividend policy, which involves a commitment to pay at least 42 cents per share.\nBad loans as a percentage of total lending rose to 4.8 percent from 4 percent in June, BBVA said. Net loans newly classified as in default rose to 1.76 billion euros in the quarter from 1.63 billion euros in the preceding three months, the lender said.\nBBVA\u2019s core capital ratio, a comparison between its core equity capital and total risk-weighted assets, was 10.8 percent, the same as in June, it said.\nThird-quarter net interest income climbed 18 percent to 3.88 billion euros as lending rose 7 percent from a year ago, BBVA said. Deposits increased 2.4 percent.\nUnnim Integration\nThe bad-loans ratio at BBVA\u2019s Spanish business jumped to 6.5 percent from 5.1 percent in June after the lender incorporated Unnim, a bank acquired earlier this year. Excluding Unnim, formed from a merger of Catalan savings banks, the bad- loans ratio was 5.7 percent, BBVA said.\nThe default rate for developer loans hit 42 percent, up 14.1 percentage points from December, as the rate for company loans jumped to 8.2 percent, up 2.5 points, Cano said.\nThird-quarter earnings from Mexico , where BBVA runs the nation\u2019s biggest bank, rose 7.4 percent to 423 million euros. Profit from South America, where the bank runs lenders from Colombia to Chile , jumped 23 percent to 303 million euros, BBVA said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Charles Penty in Madrid at cpenty@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Frank Connelly at fconnelly@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IBVC", "embersId": "f85ab6d3ab55fc78f9d5f9e9424b807316ba32f3"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-31 13:03:31", "postDate": "2012-10-31", "author": "Sarah Jones", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-31/european-stock-futures-little-changed-as-companies-report.html", "title": "European Stocks Decline as ArcelorMittal, BG Group Fall", "updateTime": "2012-10-31 15:37:09", "content": "European Stocks Decline as ArcelorMittal, BG Group Fall\nBy Sarah Jones - 2012-10-31T17:03:31Z\nEuropean stocks fell, paring the Stoxx Europe 600 Index\u2019s fifth straight monthly gain, as ArcelorMittal and BG Group Plc (BG/) reported disappointing results and euro-area governments pressured Greece to increase spending cuts in return for aid.\nArcelorMittal dropped 6.4 percent after the world\u2019s biggest steelmaker posted its smallest quarterly profit in almost three years. BG Group Plc sank a record 14 percent as its energy company\u2019s production forecast disappointed investors. Air France-KLM (AF) Group and Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) both rose at least 7 percent after Europe\u2019s largest airlines reported earnings that beat estimates.\nThe Stoxx 600 lost 0.5 percent to 270.30 at the close of trading after earlier rallying as much as 0.5 percent. The index erased gains after euro-area finance ministers called on Greece to instigate deeper budget cuts during a conference call. The gauge rose 0.7 percent in October, completing its longest monthly winning streak in six years.\n\u201cGiven the lack of progress we have seen with summits, once again, there has been a lot of words and not much action,\u201d Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG in London , said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe are seeing disillusionment with European markets. Lufthansa has kept markets from slipping down too much.\u201d\nTrading volumes across Europe were lower for the past two days amid the longest weather-related shutdown of U.S. equity markets in more than a century. The number of shares changing hands in companies listed on the Stoxx 600 (SXXP) today was 2.7 percent less than the 30-day average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Volume had been down by more than 35 percent the previous two days.\nGreek Bailout\nEuro-area governments pressed Greece to make deeper spending cuts to keep aid flowing.     With Greece pleading for a 31 billion-euro ($40 billion) aid payout in November and facing a sixth year of recession in 2013, euro finance ministers said unfreezing loans for the country required more efforts in Athens to rein in the budget deficit and deregulate the economy.\n\u201cWe called on the Greek authorities to solve remaining issues so as to swiftly finalize the negotiations,\u201d Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said in an e-mailed statement today after leading a two-and-a-half-hour conference call with finance ministers. He said their scheduled Nov. 12 meeting in Brussels would \u201cseek to conclude on the program.\u201d\nNational Indexes\nNational benchmark indexes fell in 15 of the 18 western- European markets.

Next year\u2019s payout will drop to 20 cents a share from the 75 cents planned for 2012.\nBG Group tumbled 14 percent to 1,147.5 pence, the biggest drop since the shares started trading in 1988. The U.K.\u2019s third- largest natural-gas producer forecast a 3 percent gain in full- year production growth this year and said 2013 output growth will be flat.\n\u201cThis is a big disappointment as the market had expected the start of the volume growth phase,\u201d a note from Canaccord Financial Inc. said.\nBG also signed a deal with China National Offshore Oil Corp. for the sale of its interests in Australia \u2019s Queensland Curtis LNG project for $1.9 billion and the sale of LNG from its global portfolio.\nClariant Slides\nClariant tumbled 8 percent to 9.97 Swiss francs as the maker of specialty chemicals lowered its full-year sales and profit forecasts after a \u201cmassive volume reduction in Europe.\u201d\nClariant now sees sales measured in local currencies to be unchanged this year, compared with a July 25 forecast of sales growth and sustained profitability.\nBarclays Plc (BARC) slid 4.7 percent to 227.5 pence. The bank today reported a 29 percent rise in third-quarter pretax profit to 1.73 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) and said it was the target of two more regulatory probes. Revenue from the fixed-income arm of its securities unit missed estimates.\nBarclays said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is investigating its western U.S. power trading business between 2006 and 2008 and could issue a notice of penalties as soon as today. The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are also probing whether the group\u2019s relationships with third parties who assist the bank to win or retain business comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nAirlines Climb\nAir France jumped 8.4 percent to 6.45 euros. Europe\u2019s largest airline reported a 27 percent increase in third-quarter operating profit to 506 million euros as job cuts and improved summer traffic offset higher fuel costs. Analysts had predicted earnings of 434 million euros, based on the average of nine estimates.\nLufthansa rose 7.3 percent to 11.79 euros after Europe\u2019s second-biggest airline posted a 6.2 percent increase in third- quarter operating profit to 648 million euros as a cost-savings program helped boost earnings. Analysts had estimated earnings of 522 million euros, based on nine estimates.\nFiat Industrial SpA (FI) climbed 3 percent to 8.36 euros. The truck and tractor manufacturer raised its 2012 sales target after reporting a 19 percent increase in third-quarter earnings before interest, taxes and one-time gains to 575 million euros.

The bank is focusing on personal loans amid a consumer boom in Peru that\u2019s fueling the fastest economic growth in South America .

The Bilbao, Spain-based lender is due to report earnings tomorrow before the market opens in Madrid .\nBBVA, with about 60 percent of its lending in Spain, is still booking costs to comply with government orders to banks to purge real estate that built up on their balance sheets as the country\u2019s property boom turned to bust.

The report was given to Bloomberg by a member of the business association, known by the French acronym FEC.\n\u201cThese proposals will be submitted to all parties for a consensus,\u201d Mines Minister Martin Kabwelulu said in a mobile- phone message today. The changes to the code will be negotiated at a workshop to be held at an unspecified date, Kabwelulu\u2019s chief of staff, Valery Mukasa, said in an Oct. 25 e-mail.\nCongo is the world\u2019s largest cobalt producer and was the 10th-largest exporter of copper last year, according to CRU Group, a London-based research company.

Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS) , AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) and Banro Corp. (BAA) are investing in gold mines.\nShares Fall\nBanro fell 5.8 percent to C$4.35 at the close in Toronto. Naomi Nemeth, a spokeswoman for Toronto-based Banro, said that the proposals, if implemented, would have no impact on the company because it isn\u2019t subject to Congo\u2019s mining code.\n\u201cBanro has a mining convention, which is unique in Congo,\u201d Nemeth said in a phone interview. \u201cBanro doesn\u2019t fall under the mining code.\u201d\nSimon Tuma-Waku, the national vice president in charge of mines for the FEC, criticized the proposals.\n\u201cWe feel abandoned and we were not consulted,\u201d he said in a phone interview yesterday. \u201cWhat\u2019s important for investors is the fiscal regime and stability and we think this shouldn\u2019t be modified because right now it\u2019s very attractive for investors.\u201d\nThe modifications were proposed \u201cto resolve the unequal advantages given by the mining code to investors compared to those of the state,\u201d according to the 30-page report. \u201cThe rise in the mining tax rate will lead to substantial growth in revenue for the state coming from the mining sector.\u201d\nDraft Report\nThe government hasn\u2019t officially presented the suggested changes to miners, though companies have \u201cmanaged to obtain\u201d the draft report and are concerned about the proposals, Tuma- Waku said.\nRandgold, AngloGold, Minmetals and Freeport didn\u2019t immediately respond to e-mailed requests for comment. Charles Watenphul, a Glencore spokesman, declined to comment in an e- mail.\nRandgold said in a statement on Oct. 16 that \u201cincreasing the tax burden on those who had taken the risk of investing in the DRC would not only damage the country\u2019s fledgling mining industry, it would also discourage future investors from developing new operations.\u201d\nThe report also calls for a royalty increase to 4 percent from 2 percent for non-ferrous metals, which include copper and cobalt; to 6 percent from 2.5 percent for \u201cstrategic\u201d and precious metals, such as gold; and to 6 percent from 4 percent for precious stones.\nProfit Tax\nThe recommendations include a windfall-profit tax where the state will share equally with a company any profit earned when metal prices rise 25 percent above those projected in a venture\u2019s feasibility study.\nCompanies may also be required to sign written commitments to protect the environment and help local communities. Those that don\u2019t meet their obligations may have their permits revoked, according to the report.\nOnce producing, projects may no longer benefit from preferential customs rates on imports destined for use in mining, according to the proposed changes.\nCongo will also require companies to pay a capital-gains tax in the event of a takeover, which would vary depending on the progress of the project, the report recommends.\nKabwelulu said in July that he wants to increase the percentage that mining contributes to Congo\u2019s economy to 25 percent by 2016 from 10 percent now.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Michael J.

A reading of 50 is the dividing line between expansion and contraction.\nThe S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 U.S. cities rose 2 percent in August from a year earlier, the biggest gain since July 2010, a report showed yesterday. The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, which shows whether U.S. data beat or fell short of forecasts, climbed to 55.5 on Oct. 15, the most since February. It was at 50.2 yesterday.\nU.S. consumer prices increased 2 percent in September from 12 months before, based on the latest data from the Labor Department.\nThe difference between yields on 10-year notes and same- maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations for costs in the economy over the life of the debt, was 2.48 percentage points. The average over the past decade is 2.17 percentage points.\nYield Projections\n\u201cThe U.S. economy is recovering,\u201d said Kazuaki Oh\u2019e, a debt salesman in Tokyo at CIBC World Markets Japan Inc., a unit of Canada \u2019s fifth-largest lender. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to buy at negative real yields.\u201d\nTen-year rates will climb to 2.04 percent by June 30 and to 2.33 percent by the end of 2013, based on a Bloomberg survey of economists, with the most recent projections given the heaviest weightings.\nTreasuries have handed investors a 0.3 percent loss this month as of Oct. 29, and the three-month decline is 0.8 percent, the Bank of America figures show.\nBonds in an index of U.S. investment-grade and high-yield corporate securities gained 2.5 percent since the end of July, according to the data. The MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD) of shares returned 4.4 percent including reinvested dividends in the period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nTen-year Treasury yields will probably hold below 2 percent for the weeks ahead, said Ali Jalai, who trades U.S. debt in Singapore at Scotiabank, a unit of Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , one of the 21 primary dealers authorized to deal with the Fed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a low-yield environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economy\u2019s not falling apart, but it\u2019s not that strong.\u201d\nFed Policy\nThe Fed reiterated Oct. 24 it will keep its main interest rate at almost zero until at least mid-2015 and buy $40 billion of mortgage debt every month, seeking to \u201csubstantially\u201d improve the outlook for the labor market.\nThe U.S. jobless rate rose to 7.9 percent in October from 7.8 percent in September, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists before the Labor Department reports the figures on Nov. 2. It will be the last of the monthly employment reports before President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney face off in the Nov. 6 election.\nThe Fed is also swapping its holdings of shorter-term Treasuries with those due in six years to 30 years to put downward pressure on long-term borrowing costs.\nThe central bank plans to buy as much as $5.25 billion of securities due from November 2018 to August 2020 today as part of the program, according to the Fed Bank of New York\u2019s website .\nInvestor demand for long-term debt narrowed the difference between five- and 30-year yields to 2.13 percentage points yesterday, the least in seven weeks. The spread was at 2.15 percentage points today.\nThe U.S. is scheduled to announce today the sizes of three auctions of coupon-bearing securities scheduled for next week.\nIt will probably sell $32 billion of three-year debt on Nov. 6, $24 billion of 10-year notes the next day and $16 billion of 30-year bonds on Nov. 8, according to Wrightson ICAP LLC, an economic advisory company based in Jersey City , New Jersey .\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Anchalee Worrachate in London at aworrachate@bloomberg.net ; Wes Goodman in Singapore at wgoodman@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Paul Dobson at pdobson2@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IGBVL", "embersId": "71a8059bf78bc5c88d10e5a7dbceed6e90c78142"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-30 17:23:54", "postDate": "2012-10-30", "author": "Katia Dmitrieva", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-30/canadian-dollar-snaps-five-day-losing-skid-as-hurricane-lands.html", "title": "Canadian Dollar Snaps Five-Day Losing Skid as Hurricane Lands", "updateTime": "2012-10-31 15:38:52", "content": "Canadian Dollar Snaps Five-Day Losing Skid as Hurricane Lands\nBy Katia Dmitrieva - 2012-10-30T21:23:54Z\nCanada \u2019s dollar strengthened against its U.S. peer, ending a five-day losing streak, after manufacturers\u2019 prices rose for the first time since April as Hurricane Sandy slammed into the Eastern U.S.\nThe currency, which traded below parity yesterday for the first time in more than two months, strengthened as U.S. stock and bond markets remained closed for a second day due to the storm\u2019s arrival.

He reiterated that the greatest threats to the national economy are external.\nThe central bank last week whipped markets between positive and negative growth sentiment as Carney said the need for higher interest rates has become \u201cless imminent\u201d a day after strengthening the case for tightening monetary policy.\nThe Canadian dollar may weaken further in the short-term, Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) in Toronto, said in a note to clients. It\u2019s caused by a downward shift in near-term drivers of the currency, including weaker- than-forecast global earnings weighing on growth sentiment, Canada\u2019s decision yesterday to cut the 2013 growth outlook to 2 percent, and the negative economic impact of Hurricane Sandy in the U.S.\n\u2018Bullish\u2019 View\nAfter closing past both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages this week, the loonie may test C$1.0232, its July 25 low, Sutton said. The Canadian dollar should strengthen once the early November risk of elections have passed.\n\u201cWe have made no change to our medium-term bullish Canadian dollar view,\u201d she said.\nCanadian bonds were little changed, with the yield on the 10-year benchmark note at 1.81 percent. The 2.75 percent note fell 2 cents to C$108.24.\nInvestors should reduce holdings of fixed-income securities with yields probably having reached bottom and equities set to rally as growth in North America recovers, according to BlackRock Inc.

One Canadian dollar buys $0.9990.\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials declined 0.4 percent.\nU.S. stock trading was canceled tomorrow for a second day, joining bond markets, as 90-mile-per-hour winds and surging seas from the hurricane bore down on New York and paralyzed American capital markets .\nGovernment Surplus\nThe Canadian government will post a surplus of C$3.2 billion ($3.2 billion) in the 2015-16 fiscal year following combined deficits of C$36.3 over the next three years, Parliamentary Budget Officer Kevin Page said in a report posted on his office\u2019s website today.\n\u201cThe forecast from the Canadian budget office is another headwind for the loonie,\u201d Button said. \u201cWhen you see that kind of forecast, it really takes the shine off the Canadian dollar. It certainly calls into question any ideas about a rate hike in 2013.\u201d\nBank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said last week the need for higher interest rates has become \u201cless imminent,\u201d a day after strengthening the case for a removal of monetary stimulus.\nCarney\u2019s emphasis on high debt levels was highlighted when Moody\u2019s placed Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) and four other lenders on review for possible downgrade, citing the heightened risk to Canada\u2019s economy from rising consumer debt and real estate prices.\nCanadian bank debt dropped 0.04 percent this month, the only finance bonds to lose money among those from 27 countries tracked by a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The average gain was 0.6 percent, the index shows.\nTechnical Analysis\nThe loonie\u2019s weakening below parity means it\u2019s potentially the top of a minor bear wedge and the move upwards, though prevailing, may start to \u201cgrind\u201d lower, Shaun Osborne , chief currency strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a note to clients today.\n\u201cWe remain firmly committed to the bullish\u201d U.S. dollar outlook, even as the market bumps up against what is likely to be firm resistance around the 200-day moving average, he said. Last week\u2019s move up to the upper 99-cent region \u201cputs funds on target for a push\u201d to C$1.0050 to C$1.0150 in the near term. Resistance is an area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered.\nU.S. dollar investors should buy into modest losses in spot at 99.60 to 99.65, he said.\nThe loonie has gained 0.5 percent this year against nine developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation- Weighted Indexes.

(NIHD) , which operates the Nextel brand. The plan would hurt Telefonica Brasil and Tim more because they\u2019re the top two wireless providers by subscribers.\nBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff , who this year has ordered banks to shrink interest rates and utilities to cut power bills to fuel growth and curtail inflation, is now seeking to drive down mobile-phone costs for consumers. Fees to connect calls between subscribers in Brazil are so high that users often have multiple chips that they switch in and out of their phones so they can call others at in-network rates.\n\u201cThe biggest concern of the telecom industry is the moderation of tariffs,\u201d Edu Carlier, head of equities at Schroder Investment, which manages 3 billion reais ($1.48 billion), said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. \u201cIt\u2019s a real risk and puts pressure on the whole regulatory environment.\u201d\nMarket Share\nTelefonica Brasil, the local unit of Madrid-based Telefonica SA (TEF) , had 30 percent of Brazil\u2019s 256 million mobile- phone lines at the end of June compared with Tim\u2019s 27 percent. America Movil SAB, which is controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim and operates under the Claro brand, had 25 percent of the market and Oi SA (OIBR4) had 19 percent, according to Anatel, the industry regulator. NII, whose handsets use a walkie-talkie technology, had 4.2 million local subscribers.\nThe press offices of NII, America Movil and Oi declined to comment. Telefonica and Tim said there was no one available to comment yesterday.\nAnatel, as the telecommunications regulator is known, may vote as soon as Nov. 1 on the plan to prohibit the top four mobile-phone providers from charging a fee to accept incoming calls from smaller rivals, said a government official directly involved in the discussions.\nTelefonica Brasil increased 1.4 percent to 44.80 reais at the close in Sao Paulo trading, while Tim rose 4 percent to 7.30 reais. The companies, which get more than half of their sales from mobile services, each plunged more than 13 percent in Sao Paulo trading this year.\nTim\u2019s 60-day historical volatility fell to a five-month low on Oct. 26. Tim traded at a ratio of 12.6 times reported earnings today, compared with 10.1 times for Telefonica Brasil, 7.19 for Oi and 13.8 for America Movil.\nLower Rates\nUnder the plan to be voted upon in Brasilia as early as this week, users who sign up with smaller carriers such as NII and need to call out of network regularly won\u2019t be penalized because the provider\u2019s customer base is smaller than Tim or Telefonica Brasil, said the government official who asked not to be identified because a decision is yet to be made. The move would allow NII to lure customers by offering lower rates to make out-of-network calls than rivals, the official said.\nThe change may reduce the overall cost of mobile interconnection fees, known in Brazil as VU-M, by 20 percent, the official said. Out-of-network calls cost an average of 70 percent more than in-network, the person said.\n\u2018Competitive on Price\u2019\n\u201cIf you want to promote competition, that\u2019s a way to do it,\u201d Chris King , an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore who has a buy rating on NII, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt allows Nextel to be competitive on price.\u201d\nIn a filing yesterday, NII asked Anatel for permission to take over Unicel do Brasil Telecomunicacoes SA to gain 3G mobile-phone airwaves in Sao Paulo, giving it more capacity for Internet downloads and voice traffic.\nIn addition to evaluating fee reductions, officials are preparing regulations to require land-line, wireless and cable companies to share infrastructure, Communications Minister Paulo Bernardo said last month. While such measures have been adopted in Europe , they\u2019ve also been used in developing countries where it\u2019s more difficult to build infrastructure, according to the International Telecommunications Union, a United Nations agency.\nAnatel in July banned Tim, Oi and America Movil from signing up new wireless customers for 11 days in some states to force them to address complaints about quality and customer service.\nTax Relief\nNot all the proposals being considered by the government will hurt the industry. Rousseff this year approved a law eliminating a tax on locally made equipment purchases by phone companies to expand fiber-optic networks. The measure, details of which the government has yet to disclose, is expected to save companies 6 billion reais over five years, according to the Communications Ministry\u2019s press office.\n\u201cIn the longer run, phone companies should rely less on phone calls as their main source of revenue and focus more on data services and Internet access , segments where profit margins are higher,\u201d said Joao Pedro Brugger, who helps oversee 220 million reais at Leme Investimentos in Florianopolis, Brazil. \u201cIf this happens, changes in rates related to phone calls would have little impact in their profitability.\u201d\nSince the fee plan is just a proposal, Anatel\u2019s board could vote to reject it and reconsider the plan, according to the agency\u2019s rules. Competition has already intensified as Brazil\u2019s economic growth has slowed, which may have hurt the carriers\u2019 shares more than regulation, said Valder Nogueira, an analyst at Banco Santander SA in Sao Paulo.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s intervention didn\u2019t help, but it\u2019s not the only thing that has weighed on the shares,\u201d Nogueira said. \u201cCompetition in the industry is already very strong, and one of the things we\u2019re talking about is how far the government wants to go in stimulating competition in telecom.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Carla Simoes in Brasilia Newsroom at csimoes1@bloomberg.net ; Giulia Camillo in Sao Paulo at gcamillo@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jessica Brice at jbrice1@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IGBVL", "embersId": "69bf6b6831ec3ba874b4bdb432b95c08b04692e6"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-30 13:25:22", "postDate": "2012-10-30", "author": "Manuel Baigorri, Joseph de Weck , Ruth David", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-30/telefonica-deutschland-rises-in-europe-s-biggest-2012-ipo.html", "title": "Telefonica Deutschland Rises in Europe\u2019s Biggest 2012 IPO", "updateTime": "2012-10-31 15:39:06", "content": "Telefonica Deutschland Rises in Europe\u2019s Biggest 2012 IPO\nBy Manuel Baigorri, Joseph de Weck and Ruth David - 2012-10-30T17:25:22Z\nTelefonica Deutschland Holding AG, the German unit of Spain \u2019s biggest phone company, climbed in its trading debut after completing Europe\u2019s biggest initial public offering this year.\nThe shares rose 3.6 percent to 5.80 euros in Frankfurt , valuing the Munich-based carrier at 6.5 billion euros ($8.4 billion). The company sold 258.8 million shares at 5.60 euros each, at the top of a range that was narrowed twice and in the lower half of an initial range of 5.25 euros to 6.50 euros.\nTelefonica Deutschland, operating in a market so far sheltered from Europe\u2019s debt crisis, is seeking sales growth as more people use mobile devices to surf the Web, watch video clips and send e-mail. The unit plans to pay about 500 million euros in cash dividends from 2012 earnings and has projected increasing payouts in coming years.\n\u201cInvestors will be looking at how the business generates strong cash flows in coming years in order to deliver the dividends it has promised,\u201d said Heinrich Ey, a fund manager at Allianz Global Investors in Frankfurt, which manages about 300 billion euros.\nTelefonica SA (TEF) , the Spanish parent with more than 58 billion euros of net debt, is Europe\u2019s most indebted phone company. Chief Executive Officer Cesar Alierta is reversing a decade-long expansion strategy as it rushes to avoid a downgrade of its debt ratings . The Madrid-based company also plans to sell shares of its Latin American unit and divested a $1.4 billion stake in China Unicom ( Hong Kong ) Ltd. in July.\nTougher Competition\nWhile the majority of shares were allocated to European funds, demand was strong among U.S. investors, according to two people with knowledge of the sale, asking not to be identified as the information isn\u2019t public.\n\u201c Germany is one of the best markets,\u201d Ey said. \u201cHowever, competition could raise challenges down the road, especially if a cut on mobile termination rates triggers a price war among the smaller rivals.\u201d\nEven as Germany\u2019s economy has held up better than those of Spain and Italy , it is facing a slowdown that may prompt consumers to start looking for lower mobile-phone rates. German unemployment climbed twice as much as economists forecast in October, the Federal Labor Agency said today. The economy may contract in the fourth quarter as slowing global growth and Europe \u2019s debt crisis crimp demand for its exports, the Bundesbank said last week.\nIPO Drought\n\u201cThe European economy is in a much better place than three years ago even if we are not out of the woods yet,\u201d Telefonica Deutschland CEO Rene Schuster told reporters today in Frankfurt. \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be another price war in Germany. What we will see and what we want is the introduction of inexpensive smartphones -- maybe as low as 50 euros.\u201d\nBefore today, IPOs in Europe, the Middle East and Africa have raised $8.5 billion this year, compared with $37 billion in the same period in 2011, as market volatility caused by Europe\u2019s sovereign debt crisis slowed the pace of sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nTalanx AG (TLX) , Germany\u2019s third-biggest insurer, has risen 6.8 percent since the stock began trading on Oct. 2. Dutch cable company Ziggo NV (ZIGGO) has climbed about 38 percent since its March 21 debut.\nTelefonica Deutschland\u2019s IPO is the biggest in Germany since engine maker Tognum AG (TGM) raised 1.8 billion euros in 2007, according to Bloomberg data. For the telecommunications industry, it is the largest in Europe since Belgacom SA\u2019s 3.59 billion-euro sale in 2004.\nNetwork Sharing?\nTelefonica Deutschland vies with Royal KPN NV (KPN) \u2019s E-Plus for the position of the third-largest wireless company in Germany, where Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) and Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) are the leaders. Telefonica Deutschland is considering sharing its network with E-Plus to lower costs after the two businesses abandoned talks for a merger this year.\n\u201cThe whole sector is talking to each other,\u201d Schuster said today in a speech at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. \u201cThere is nothing at the moment -- we are focused on the IPO, the Christmas business and then we will see next year.\u201d\nA hypothetical merger of Telefonica Deutschland and E-Plus could generate savings worth about 4 billion euros for the companies, according to a document prepared by one of the banks managing the IPO and obtained by Bloomberg News . KPN said last year that such a deal may generate 3 billion euros of savings.\nDividend Cuts\nThe IPO of Telefonica Deutschland, which failed to get the upper end of its price range, shows how challenging times are for stock sales in Europe, Allianz Global Investors\u2019 Ey said.\n\u201cThe fact that there have been several dividend cuts and profit warnings in the last year or so makes it harder to attract investors, as many of them are already very underweight on the industry as a whole,\u201d he said.\nFrance Telecom SA said last week it will reduce its payout to as low as 80 cents a share as it copes with a more difficult environment than expected. The cut was the second this year for the owner of the Orange brand and marks a drop from a 2011 dividend of 1.40 euros.\nIn July, Telefonica scrapped a 1.5 euro-a-share dividend for 2012 and said it plans to resume half of the payout toward the end of next year. It also cut a revenue forecast and slashed compensation for top executives including Alierta.\nTelefonica Deutschland\u2019s dividend yield is almost 8 percent, slightly above the rest of the industry in Europe, according to Francisco Salvador, a strategist at FGA/MG Valores in Madrid . That, combined with higher earnings-growth potential compared with its peers, may be the main reason why the IPO succeeded, he said.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Manuel Baigorri in Madrid at mbaigorri@bloomberg.net ; Joseph de Weck in Berlin at jdeweck@bloomberg.net ; Ruth David in London at rdavid9@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net\nTelefonica Deutschland Climbs in Europe\u2019s Biggest IPO This Year\nTelefonica Germany GmbH & Co. via Bloomberg\nTelefonica Deutschland, operating in a market so far sheltered from Europe\u2019s debt crisis, is seeking sales growth as more people use mobile devices to surf the Web, watch video clips and send e-mail.\nTelefonica Deutschland, operating in a market so far sheltered from Europe\u2019s debt crisis, is seeking sales growth as more people use mobile devices to surf the Web, watch video clips and send e-mail.

The median forecast of 25 economists in a Bloomberg survey projected a 1.9 percent gain.\nSandy Shutdown\nStandard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index futures gained 0.2 percent from the Oct. 26 close to 1,411.1, having earlier fallen as much as 1 percent. Trading in the securities ended at 9:15 a.m. New York time again today as weather stopped U.S. equity trading for two straight days for the first time since 1888.\nSandy came ashore near Atlantic City, New Jersey, at about 8 p.m. New York time yesterday. The system is no longer a hurricane, because it\u2019s drawing energy from temperature differences and not the ocean, making the transition to a superstorm that may push a wall of water ashore in the Northeast and lash the East with wind, rain and snow.\nNational benchmark indexes advanced in 15 of the 18 western-European markets. Germany\u2019s DAX climbed 1.1 percent, the U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 gained 1 percent and France \u2019s CAC 40 rallied 1.5 percent.\nVolume Decline\nThe number of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies was 44 percent lower than the 30-day average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Volume on the Euro Stoxx 50 was 57 percent lower, the data showed.\nEconomic confidence in the euro area fell to the lowest in more than three years in October. An index of executive and consumer sentiment dropped to 84.5 from 85.2 in September, the European Commission said. Economists had forecast a decrease to 84.4, the median of 27 estimates in a Bloomberg survey showed.\nA measure of oil and gas companies in the Stoxx 600 gained 1.8 percent for the biggest contribution to the equity benchmark\u2019s advance today.\nBP jumped 4.2 percent to 442.85 pence, the largest jump in 11 months. The company said third-quarter net income rose to $5.4 billion from $5 billion in the same period of 2011 and raised its dividend by 12.5 percent to 9 cents a share. Profit adjusted for one-time items and changes in inventory was $5.2 billion, compared with the average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg of $4 billion.\nEni SpA (ENI) added 2.1 percent to 17.69 euros as Italy \u2019s largest oil producer reported third-quarter adjusted net income from continuing operations of 1.78 billion euros ($2.3 billion). Analysts in a Bloomberg survey had forecast 1.56 billion euros.\nDeutsche Bank\nDeutsche Bank increased 4.5 percent to 34.80 euros. The lender said third-quarter profit rose 3 percent after investment-banking revenue exceeded targets. Net income climbed to 747 million euros in the three months through September from 725 million euros a year earlier, the company said. That beat the 563.9 million-euro average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\nUBS climbed 5.9 percent to 13.89 Swiss francs, its highest price since July 25, 2011. The bank said it plans to save about 3.4 billion francs ($3.7 billion) in additional annual costs by the end of 2015 as it reduces headcount by 10,000 to about 54,000. The company will target a return on equity of at least 15 percent starting in 2015, compared with a previous goal of 12 percent to 17 percent.\nErste Group Bank AG (EBS) advanced 6.3 percent to 19.07 euros in Vienna. Europe\u2019s third-biggest lender said net income rose to 143.7 million euros in the three months through September, after a 1.5 billion-euro loss a year earlier. That matched the average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\nBiggest IPO\nTelefonica Deutschland Holding AG gained 3.6 percent to 5.80 euros. The German unit of Spain\u2019s largest phone company climbed in its Frankfurt trading debut after completing Europe\u2019s biggest initial public offering this year.

Bernanke is fueling a record-long winning streak in corporate debt as the money he pumps into the economy spurs investors to seek riskier assets to generate returns.\nBonds sold by companies around the world, from the neediest to the most creditworthy, are on pace to generate 11 straight months of positive returns, bringing gains over the period to 12.9 percent through Oct. 26, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Investor demand has narrowed the yield premium over benchmark government securities to 225 basis points, or 2.25 percentage points, from 356 on Nov. 30, 2011.\nAfter four years of holding its main interest rate at about zero, Bernanke said in September he expects no change in policy through mid-2015 to complement $40 billion of monthly mortgage- bond purchases in an effort to boost growth. With central banks across the world using similar strategies, investors have turned to corporate debt, whose default rates are running below historical averages, as alternatives to government securities.\n\u201cThe actions by the Federal Reserve have left no choice,\u201d said Scott Colyer, the chief executive officer of Advisors Asset Management Inc., which oversees about $9.5 billion in Monument, Colorado . \u201cIf they keep the pedal down\u201d we may \u201chave another year next year that rivals this one in corporate debt,\u201d he said.\nNext Year\nCorporate debt has strengthened even as the International Monetary Fund lowered its global growth forecast to the slowest pace since the 2009 recession. Concern that Europe will cause an international financial contagion is mounting as Spain\u2019s economy contracts for a fifth quarter and Greece struggles to obtain international aid.\nThat scenario, combined with record-low yields, may diminish prospects for further gains.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen a goldilocks environment for credit issuers, but for investors the outlook is less favorable,\u201d said Sam Diedrich, a money manager at Pacific Alternative Asset Management Co., which oversees $8.5 billion. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a market that\u2019s very conducive to credit because you have low interest rates, low default rates, and high investor demand for yield. However going forward, we see value in other areas outside\u201d high-yield markets, such as structured products, he said.\nTelefonica Leads\nTelefonica Emisiones SAU, a financing unit of Spain\u2019s biggest phone-services company, led returns of 3.51 percent this month on Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s Global Broad Market Corporate & High Yield Index. The company\u2019s bonds were followed by Italian rival Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) , which gained 2.79 percent. Overall, returns total 0.9 percent this month, the same as in September.\nElsewhere in credit markets, trading of fixed-income securities in the U.S. is closed today after the Atlantic superstorm Sandy paralyzed Wall Street. A gauge of credit risk tied to junk-rated companies in Europe fell for the first time in almost two weeks. Fresenius Medical Care AG, the world\u2019s biggest provider of kidney dialysis, is said to be signing about $3.85 billion in loans today to refinance its outstanding debt.\nThe Markit iTraxx Crossover Index, a credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to speculate on the creditworthiness of 50 mostly junk-rated European companies, dropped 18.1 basis points to 526.5 basis points at 3:41 p.m. in London . The decline snapped eight days of increases.\nFresenius Loans\nCredit-default swaps typically fall as investor confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates. The contracts pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a swap protecting $10 million of debt.\nFresenius\u2019s five-year deal comprises a $2.6 billion term loan A and a revolving credit facility of about $1.25 billion, according to two people with knowledge of the situation, who asked not to be identified because the transaction is private. The Bad Homburg, Germany-based company canceled a planned term loan B because of demand for the term loan A, which was increased from $1.8 billion, the people said.\nTerm loan A facilities are sold mainly to banks while B and C portions are usually taken by non-bank investors such as collateralized loan obligations, bank loan mutual funds and hedge funds.\nLeading Gains\nEurope leads gains in corporate bonds this year, as policy makers\u2019 efforts to ease the sovereign crisis lured investors seeking alternatives to benchmark government securities with often negative yields.\nEuropean corporate debt returned 14.8 percent, compared with 0.6 percent in the same period of 2011, according to Bank of America Merrill Index data. U.S. company notes earned 10.6 percent, up from 5.7 percent, the data show. Globally, returns climbed from the 4 percent achieved in the year to Oct. 26, 2011.\nGlobal sales totaled $3.3 trillion year-to-date, up from $2.8 trillion in the same period of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe amount investors earn from corporate debt will decline in 2013 because of the effect of western governments\u2019 spending cuts on economic growth, according to analysts at Societe Generale SA and National Australia Bank Ltd.\nPredicting Growth\nThe IMF is predicting the world economy will grow 3.3 percent this year and 3.6 percent next year, it said on Oct. 9. That compares with July predictions of 3.5 percent in 2012 and 3.9 percent in 2013. The Washington-based lender now sees \u201calarmingly high\u201d risks of a steeper slowdown, with a one-in- six chance of growth slipping below 2 percent.\n\u201cReturns this year have been superb, however we can\u2019t expect these to be replicated in 2013,\u201d said Simon Ballard, senior credit strategist at NAB in London. \u201cGiven the on-going macroeconomic challenges from austerity, we would anticipate a drop in returns for investment-grade issuance from current levels back toward the low- to mid-single digits next year, and on high yield, back to the high-single digits area at best.\u201d\nGrowth in U.S. gross domestic product will slow to 2 percent next year, from 2.1 percent in 2012, according to the median estimate of 89 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Governments across Europe are also implementing austerity as an economic policy to cut unsustainable debt levels and meet requirements for staying in the euro.\n\u2018Substantially Lower\u2019\n\u201cOur forecast for 2013 is not ready yet, but we expect returns to be substantially lower -- 3 percent would be a good starting point,\u201d said Suki Mann , SocGen\u2019s London-based head of credit strategy. He maintained his forecast of 12 percent returns for this year.\nCorporate bonds appeal because of their relative yield and safety. The global speculative-grade default rate of 3 percent as of the end of the third quarter was lower than the 4.8 percent historical average since 1983, according to an Oct. 8 report by Moody\u2019s Investors Service. That\u2019s still almost double the 1.8 percent rate of a year ago as the euro-region crisis in particular hurts company earnings.\n\u201cThe corporate default rate has remained low and stable for some time now, despite some very weak economic fundamentals,\u201d Albert Metz, a Moody\u2019s analyst, wrote in the report. \u201cWith ample liquidity available, we are not expecting that to change over the coming months.\u201d\nECB Rate\nThe European Central Bank cut its main refinancing rate a quarter-percentage point to a record-low 0.75 percent in July, after starting to reduce it at the end of 2008. This pushed yields on the safest European government bonds including Germany \u2019s and Austria \u2019s, below zero. Only after ECB President Mario Draghi reassured markets by announcing an unlimited bond- buying program on Sept. 6 did they start rising again.\nThe yield on Germany\u2019s two-year note dropped to an all-time low of minus 0.097 percent on Aug. 2, and was 0.04 percent today, while the Netherlands\u2019 similar-maturity bond fell to minus 0.035 percent on the same day, before recovering to 0.084 percent. U.S. two-year Treasury rates declined to 0.143 percent in September 2011 and hovered above 0.2 percent for much of this year, reaching 0.285 percent yesterday.\n\u201cDemand for credit is still strong,\u201d said NAB\u2019s Ballard. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of cash out there looking to get invested and seeking yield.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Matt Robinson in New York at Mrobinson55@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alan Goldstein at agoldstein5@bloomberg.net ; Paul Armstrong at parmstrong10@bloomberg.net\nU.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.

(ILD)\nFitch Ratings today lowered France Telecom\u2019s rating by one level to BBB+, the third-lowest investment grade. Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s Investors Service rate the company one notch higher at the fourth-lowest investment grade.\nFrance Telecom reduced its planned dividend last week for a second time this year after third-quarter earnings and sales declined, in a bid to keep debt under control and avoid credit- rating cuts. The move followed similar dividend reductions from European peers such as Telefonica SA. (TEF)\n\u201cA telecom incumbent cannot be rated in the A category when its domestic business is hemorrhaging,\u201d said Roger Appleyard , head of global credit research at RBC Capital Markets in London . \u201cThe French market is so competitive, with companies such as Iliad or SFR or Bouygues, that we don\u2019t really know where the bottom is.\u201d\nIliad, founded by French entrepreneur Xavier Niel, scooped up about 5.4 percent of the French mobile market in its first six months of business after it started selling discounted phone packages in January under the brand name Free. It distributes exclusively over the Internet and doesn\u2019t subsidize handsets, in a strategy based on lower prices and costs on average compared with those of rivals France Telecom, SFR -- a Vivendi SA (VIV) unit -- and Bouygues SA. (EN)\nDomestic Pressure\n\u201cThe downgrade is based on the continued pressures in France Telecom\u2019s core domestic business,\u201d Fitch said today. \u201cIncreased competition is causing the company\u2019s cash flows to decline.\u201d\nFrance Telecom\u2019s 1 billion euros of senior unsecured bonds due June 2022 today fell 0.3 percent to 103.87 cents on the euro, according to Bloomberg prices.\nFrance Telecom has said its operating cash flow would only grow again in 2014 once pricing pressure stabilizes in France. Chief Executive Officer Stephane Richard refocused on preserving cash eight months ago, when the company cut its dividend forecast for the first time and abandoned a promise to buy back shares.\nDiscounter\u2019s Push\nStill, the Paris-based company also faces the threat of having its credit rating reduced for the first time since 2002 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, which said in August that the company may have trouble sustaining debt ratios. Standard & Poor\u2019s also has a negative outlook on France Telecom\u2019s rating.\n\u201cFrance Telecom is set to lose all three of its A ratings and Fitch kicked the process off,\u201d Appleyard said. \u201cIts just a matter of time before Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s downgrade the company\u2019s ratings as well.\u201d\nAs competitive pressures weigh on prices, especially in France, France Telecom is betting it can charge consumers more by investing in improved networks and new services. Richard said this month that the rollout of a faster wireless Internet network is vital to charge clients more money.\n\u201cAlthough Fitch recognizes the importance of these investments for the company\u2019s long-term success, in Fitch\u2019s opinion the current economic climate is not conducive to such an investment,\u201d Fitch said. \u201cConsumers may not be willing to increase their telecoms spend in times of austerity.\u201d\nFrance Telecom declined 29 percent in Paris trading this year through yesterday, making the stock the third-worst performer in the country\u2019s CAC 40 benchmark Index which gained 7.9 percent. Today, France Telecom was up 0.8 percent as of 3:19 p.m.\nFrance Telecom, the owner of the Orange brand, said Oct. 25 that it will pay a dividend of at least 80 cents ($1.04) each for 2012 and 2013, as much as 41 percent lower than last year.

The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association also recommended that trading resume tomorrow of U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-income securities.\nJobs Report\nThe Labor Department is striving to issue its monthly report on employment in the U.S. in three days as scheduled, a spokesman said today. The jobs report is the last before the presidential election, and may help sway voters trying to decide between giving President Barack Obama another four years in office or to change course with Republican challenger Mitt Romney .\nNonfarm payrolls increased by 125,000 workers in October and the jobless rate rose to 7.9 percent, the reports on Nov. 2 may show, according to median forecasts of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\nThe S&P/Case-Shiller Index of property values in 20 cities rose 2 percent in August from a year earlier, after a 1.2 percent advance in July, a report showed today.

Carrefour has also put its Polish and Turkish units under review and is considering a combination of the latter with competitor Migros Ticaret AS (MGROS) , according to people familiar with the situation.\nCarrefour is preparing a $4.9 billion initial public offering of its Atacadao cash-and-carry unit, Veja magazine reported Oct. 27.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Yuki Yamaguchi in Tokyo at yyamaguchi10@bloomberg.net ; Andrew Roberts in Paris at aroberts36@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Stephanie Wong at swong139@bloomberg.net ; Celeste Perri at cperri@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "CHILE65", "embersId": "bfeb2a0fd337ac2e9b529ea8a34875b9a9cb0b86"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-30 20:01:59", "postDate": "2012-10-30", "author": "Matthew Brown", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-31/gas-golden-age-darkens-in-europe-on-u-s-coal-energy-markets.html", "title": "Gas Golden Age Darkens in Europe on U.S. Coal: Energy Markets", "updateTime": "2012-10-31 15:44:25", "content": "Gas Golden Age Darkens in Europe on U.S. Coal: Energy Markets\nBy Matthew Brown - 2012-10-31T00:01:59Z\nEurope is missing out on the natural gas boom that is transforming energy use in the U.S. and Asia, instead burning cheaper, dirtier coal imported from America.\nGlobal gas consumption may rise 19 percent by 2017 from 2010 levels as demand surges in Asia and the U.S. while Europe\u2019s usage drops 1.6 percent, according to the International Energy Agency . Increasing coal-fired generation in Europe has cut gas demand by 3 billion cubic feet a day, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., about 7 percent of consumption. The IEA last year predicted a golden age for the fuel with new exports from America to Australia .\nEuropean utilities\u2019 preference for burning coal to generate electricity is pushing up carbon emissions even after the region invested twice as much in renewable energy as the U.S. since 2004. In Europe, gas costs three times as much as in the U.S., cutting competitiveness at industrial users such as Germany\u2019s BASF SE (BAS) , the world\u2019s largest chemical maker.\n\u201cWe are in the dark ages of gas in Europe and have some kind of golden age of coal,\u201d Anne-Sophie Corbeau, an analyst at the IEA, said in an Oct. 9 interview in London . \u201cWe are looking at relatively rapid growth of gas demand in the world, but Europe doesn\u2019t want to go in that direction.\u201d\nGas for delivery next month on the Netherlands\u2019 Title Transfer Facility, the mainland European benchmark, traded at 27.50 euros ($35.65) a megawatt-hour yesterday, more than double the price four years ago, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s equivalent to $10.43 per million British thermal units and compares with $3.69 per million Btu for front- month fuel in the U.S., which fell 43 percent over the period.\nLoss-Making\nGerman power stations make a loss of 11.25 euros a megawatt-hour from burning gas, according to Bloomberg calculations of the so-called clean-spark spread, which takes into account electricity, fuel and carbon prices for next month.\nThe equivalent measure when burning European coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp shows a profit of 14.22 euros a megawatt-hour. U.S. Central Appalachian Coal Futures for the next month traded at $59.43 a short ton on Oct. 29, excluding shipping, versus $84.85 a metric ton ($93.53 a short ton) for European coal.\n\u201cGas is too expensive a fuel for Europe,\u201d Thierry Bros, an analyst at Societe Generale SA in Paris, said in an Oct. 3 webcast. \u201cWith gas demand further down, it looks like the major producers will be compelled to agree to alternative pricing.\u201d\nMore than half of Europe\u2019s supply of the fuel is bought through long-term contracts linked to the price of oil, and that will remain the case until 2014, according to Societe Generale. Brent crude has climbed 72 percent over the past four years.\nContract Renegotiations\nEven after a wave of renegotiations, most prices for gas from Russia\u2019s OAO Gazprom (OGZD) , which meets about a third of the EU\u2019s needs through contracts tied to oil, were revised down no more than 10 percent, Bros said. Disputes remain with RWE AG (RWE) , Germany\u2019s second-largest utility, and Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA, the Polish gas company known as PGNiG.\nWhile European buyers battled with Gazprom, U.S. prices plummeted, reaching a decade-low $1.902 per million Btu on April 19, as new technologies made it possible to extract gas from previously inaccessible shale formations.\nHydraulic fracturing, the process known as fracking, where water, chemicals and sand are pumped into wells to create fissures in rocks to release fuel, helped make the U.S. the world\u2019s largest gas producer last year, creating a glut that displaced record amounts of coal in electricity generation.\nU.S. gas demand from power plants jumped 18 percent in September from a year earlier, according to the Energy Department in Washington. European imports of U.S. coal jumped 32 percent to 34.2 million short tons in the first six months of the year, data from the department\u2019s Energy Information Administration show.\nU.S. Coal\nBurning coal has contributed to a 10 percent increase in EU carbon-dioxide output this year through September, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. First-quarter emissions from power generation in the U.S. dropped to the lowest since 1992 because of increased gas usage and a milder-than-normal winter, the EIA said in an Aug. 1 report.\nEU emissions are rising even after the region received more than double the investment in clean energy sources that the U.S. got this year, at $61.7 billion versus $27.8 billion, BNEF data show. Since 2004, the difference is $511 billion versus $250.9 billion.\n\u201cIf you burn gas in a power plant you burn money; if you burn coal, you make money,\u201d Walter Boltz, vice chairman at the Agency for Cooperation of Energy Regulators, said in an Oct. 9 interview in London. \u201cGiven our climate goals, that\u2019s the stupidest thing we can do, but commercial realities force companies to do that.\u201d\nDifferent Regions\nThe variation in pricing, availability and industrial base in Europe, the U.S. and China may delay the triumph of gas.\n\u201cA golden age for gas may not prevail soon or everywhere,\u201d John Mitchell , a researcher at international affairs think tank Chatham House in London, said in an Oct. 8 report. \u201cFor this to happen each major region needs prices which are low enough to increase demand but high enough to increase supply. Relying on imports to build new gas demand will seem risky to some countries.\u201d\nDuPont Co. and Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) , the third- and fourth- largest chemical makers by market value, enjoy an 8 percent profit advantage over Ludwigshafen-based BASF because they pay less for the fuel, according to Jeremy Redenius, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in London.\nBASF is taking a \u201cdeeper dive\u201d into investigating opportunities to harness shale gas in the U.S., Chief Executive Officer Kurt Bock said in an interview with Linzie Janis on Bloomberg Television\u2019s \u201cCountdown\u201d on Oct. 25. Passing on raw material costs has become more difficult, he said.\nOil Pricing\nEON AG (EOAN) , Germany\u2019s biggest utility, lost 79 million euros in its mid-stream business last year from buying gas linked to oil prices and selling it at the prevailing spot price. RWE Supply & Trading, the corresponding unit at RWE, lost 336 million euros in the first half.\nEuropean utilities including EON and RWE will open six times more coal-burning plants than gas-fed units by 2015, UBS AG said in a Sept. 5 research note.\nPower generators have closed, mothballed or delayed at least 3.8 gigawatts of gas-fired generation in the U.K. and Germany in the past two years, enough to power about 7.6 million European homes, with a further 1 gigawatt planned over the coming 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nAdvanced Power AG, an independent power-plant developer in Zug, Switzerland, has postponed plans to build a 420-megawatt gas-fired station in Germany until 2013, two years later than planned. In the U.K., GDF Suez SA (GSZ) cut generation at its 1,875- megawatt Teesside plant to 45 megawatts.\nU.S. Power\nU.S. gas use in power generation rose 14 percent from 2008 to 2011 to 20.8 billion cubic feet a day and will grow a further 9 percent to 22.7 billion cubic feet a day by 2013, according to the EIA\u2019s latest short-term energy outlook.\nWhile gas costs are hurting industry in Europe, Asian users are overcoming higher prices to expand their use of the fuel.\nCompetition within Asia helped push the average price for Japanese imports of LNG, gas chilled to a liquid for transportation by sea, to a record $18.07 per million Btu in July, according to finance ministry data.\nJapan needs to replace the world\u2019s third-largest nuclear fleet, which produced 841 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2010, according to the BP Statistical Review, after promising to scrap its atomic-power program by 2040 following the Fukushima Dai- Ichi disaster last year.\nJapan and South Korea , both of which rely on LNG for all their natural gas, are facing increased competition from China, which is predicted by the IEA to quadruple its use of the fuel in power generation to 914 terawatt-hours by 2020, and to 1,994 terawatt-hours by 2035.\nLNG Prices\nLNG prices must fall if it is to be affordable for buyers in India and China, Shigeru Muraki, executive vice president of Tokyo Gas Co., said at a conference in London on Oct. 8. A price of $9 to $11 per million Btu is needed if the fastest-growing consumers are to be able to stop subsidizing the fuel, he said.\nThe trajectory of Asian prices will depend on China\u2019s ability to exploit its indigenous shale reserves, according to the IEA\u2019s Corbeau.\n\u201cThe question for China is: where is the supply coming from?\u201d she said. \u201cWill shale gas be a reality in China? The jury\u2019s out. It\u2019s a huge question mark.\u201d\nShale development in China, home to the world\u2019s biggest so- called unconventional gas resources, has been slower than predicted by the government. China may produce 6.5 billion cubic meters of shale gas by 2015 and set a target of 60 billion to 100 billion cubic meters by 2020, according to the National Development and Reform Commission.\nChinese Shale\nA higher population density than the U.S. and about a fifth the amount of water availability are major hurdles to China fulfilling its shale ambitions, according to Fan Gao, a research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.\nAs China\u2019s population becomes increasingly aware of health and safety issues, environmental concerns could be a \u201cshow- stopper,\u201d she said.\nFracking has also met opposition in Europe. It is awaiting government approval in the U.K., after two tremors near sites last year, and banned in France and Bulgaria. In Poland, where it is allowed, techniques used in the U.S. failed.\nExxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) will return two of its six Polish shale gas exploration licenses to the government after it decided to leave the country in June, the world\u2019s biggest energy company said last month.\n\u201cEurope: the \u2018golden age\u2019 finished in 2008 when demand peaked,\u201d said Jonathan Stern , chairman and founder of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. \u201cSince then we have been in a downward spiral. Can we stop the decline? Only if the commercial environment changes completely. Otherwise it\u2019s renewables all the way.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Matthew Brown in London at mbrown42@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Lars Paulsson at lpaulsson@bloomberg.net\nGas Golden Age Darkens in Europe on U.S. Coal\nVincent Mundy/Bloomberg\nEuropean utilities\u2019 preference for burning coal to generate electricity is pushing up carbon emissions even after the region invested twice as much in renewable energy as the U.S. since 2004.\nEuropean utilities\u2019 preference for burning coal to generate electricity is pushing up carbon emissions even after the region invested twice as much in renewable energy as the U.S. since 2004.

(6501) agreed to buy Horizon Nuclear Power from Germany\u2019s two largest utilities for 696 million pounds ($1.1 billion), ensuring support for the U.K. government\u2019s energy program.\nThe transaction will be completed next month and secure financial backing for as many as six new nuclear reactors at two sites in Britain, according to a statement from Hitachi and the utilities, RWE AG (RWE) and EON AG. (EOAN) The German companies are withdrawing as the nation closes its own nuclear plants.\nThe deal helps Hitachi\u2019s goal to more than double nuclear sales to 360 billion yen ($4.5 billion) by 2021 and underpins U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron \u2019s decision remain one of three western European nations expanding atomic power. Horizon is part of Britain\u2019s 110 billion-pound program to replace aging power plants, upgrade grids and cut pollution.\n\u201cThis is a decades-long, multi-billion pound vote of confidence in the U.K. that will contribute vital new infrastructure to power our economy,\u201d Cameron said in a statement released by the government in London today.\nThe German utilities decided to sell Horizon after opting to close all of its reactors by 2022 following the 2011 atomic disaster in Japan . That raised questions about whether the Horizon venture could go forward.\nInvestment Program\n\u201cToday\u2019s investment furthers our investment links in the U.K. with the start of what is likely to be approximately 20 billion-pounds investment program in the U.K.\u2019s energy infrastructure,\u201d Tatsuro Ishizuka, vice president and chief executive officer of Power Systems Company of Hitachi, said today at a conference in London .\nFor EON and RWE, the Horizon deal comes at \u201ca good price and could even cause a little book profit,\u201d Daniel Seidenspinner, an analyst at B. Metzler Seel Sohn & Co. KGaA, said today by phone from Frankfurt. However, it is \u201cno act of liberation\u201d for RWE, which is struggling to reach its asset- sales target of 7 billion euros by the end of 2013.\n\u201cNo profit is lost by the sale,\u201d Matthias Heck, an analyst at Macquarie Capital Europe Ltd., said by phone from Frankfurt. He said the purchase price was \u201creasonable.\u201d\nFor Hitachi, the investment represents a \u201cleap of faith\u201d that the British government will backstop the profitability of the venture by ensuring higher electricity prices, said George Borovas, head of nuclear projects at law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP.\nEDF Talks\nThe U.K. government is in talks with Electricite de France SA about the price it will pay for power from nuclear plants. EDF has warned it won\u2019t move forward with funding for replacing its plants without a commercial price. Environmental groups say nuclear power will be too expensive and should be scrapped.\n\u201cInstead of waiting years to find out how much bill-payers will end up subsidising this project, the government should join Japan and Germany, abandon nuclear, and invest instead in clean, renewable energy,\u201d said Leila Deen, an energy campaigner for Greenpeace.\nBritain, which gets about 22 percent of its power from nuclear plants, must replace those facilities within the next two decades. It\u2019s seeking to support the industry through changes to rules governing the electricity markets.\n\u2018Strike Price\u2019\nEnergy Secretary Ed Davey said at the London conference he will put the final proposals for a vote by lawmakers in Parliament \u201cwithin weeks.\u201d He said the government and Hitachi will start discussions similar to those currently on going with EDF over the so-called \u201cstrike price.\u201d\n\u201cThe British government should not take this preliminary investment as an irreversible commitment to build new nuclear plants in the U.K., but should illustrate to investors that they will find a willing and supportive partner in the U.K. government,\u201d Borovas said. The deal opens up the possibility of access to Japanese export credit agency and commercial financing, he said.\nU.K. companies Babcock International Group Plc (BAB) and Rolls- Royce Holdings Plc (RR/) and Canada\u2019s SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. (SNC) have agreed to join Hitachi to \u201cplan and deliver\u201d the construction project, the Japanese company said.\n\u201cToday starts our 100 year commitment to the U.K. and its vision to achieve a long-term, secure, low-carbon, and affordable energy supply,\u201d Hitachi President Hiroaki Nakanishi said in a statement.\nPlants Planned\nHitachi plans to build two to three nuclear plants with capacity of about 1,300-megawatts each at Wylfa, Anglesey, and Oldbury, Gloucestershire, it said. The company plans to start operation of one of the units in the first half of the 2020s.\nThe Japanese company expects to create as many as 6,000 jobs at each site during the construction period and another 1,000 permanent jobs per site after starting operations, it said. Cameron said the venture will support 12,000 jobs during construction and \u201cthousands more\u201d skilled ones when the plant begins operating.\n\u201cHitachi bring with them decades of expertise, and are responsible for building some of the most advanced nuclear reactors on time and on budget,\u201d Davey said. \u201cNew nuclear isn\u2019t only about keeping the lights on and emissions down, it\u2019s an industrial strategy with big potential wins,\u201d he said, also welcoming Hitachi\u2019s plans for a U.K. module assembly facility.\nPartners Sought\nMasaharu Hanyu, Hitachi\u2019s vice president, indicated the company may seek other partners in the venture as it would be difficult to raise the \u201cmassive construction costs\u201d alone.\nMizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) and Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) have been hired as financial advisers for the projects, Hanyu told reporters in Tokyo today.\nHitachi sold its profitable hard-disk drive unit to Western Digital Corp. (WDC) in March and earlier sold a stake in Elpida Memory Inc. as it expanded into infrastructure and power businesses from electronics.\nAn earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 caused triple meltdowns at Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) \u2019s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station, causing mass evacuations and leaving some areas uninhabitable for decades. On Sept. 14 this year, Japan Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda approved a policy to stop building atomic plants and to phase out nuclear power by 2040.\n\u2018Overseas Markets\u2019\n\u201cNakanishi is targeting overseas markets as nuclear business prospects have dimmed at home\u201d since Japan adopted a policy to phase out atomic power, Yoshiharu Izumi , an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) in Tokyo, said by phone before the announcement.\nIn contrast, U.K. industry has set out plans to build 16 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2025 and the government has designated eight sites for plants. Those goals appeared at risk when Areva SA (AREVA) and China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group Co. pulled out of the bidding for Horizon this month. That left Electricite de France SA (EDF) , Iberdrola SA (IBE) and GDF Suez (GSZ) SA as the only developers advancing U.K. nuclear projects.\nHitachi\u2019s Advanced Boiling Water Reactor, which it makes with General Electric Co. (GE) , has been licensed in the U.S., Taiwan and Japan. While it is yet to seek U.K. approval through a process known as Generic Design Assessment, the reactor equipment already operates in Japan. Hitachi\u2019s Ishizuka said today he expected the GDA approval process to take three to four years.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Tsuyoshi Inajima in Tokyo at tinajima@bloomberg.net ; Yuji Okada in Tokyo at yokada6@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jason Rogers at jrogers73@bloomberg.net\nHitachi to Buy Horizon Nuclear JV From EON, RWE for $1.1 Billion\nJunko Kimura/Bloomberg\nThe deal will help Hitachi with its plan to more than double nuclear sales to 360 billion yen by the end of March 2021.\nThe deal will help Hitachi with its plan to more than double nuclear sales to 360 billion yen by the end of March 2021.

Adjusted net income was 2.51 billion reais when including one-time items.\nAmBev rose 31 percent from this year\u2019s low on Jan. 10 through yesterday, while the Bovespa dropped 3.5 percent.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Denyse Godoy in Sao Paulo at dgodoy2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Papadopoulos at papadopoulos@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IBOV", "embersId": "100c98a136d8eb8d17c28cd50dbf3653aa9e613e"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-31 08:14:53", "postDate": "2012-10-31", "author": "Henry Meyer , Stepan Kravchenko", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-30/putin-wages-war-on-vodka-as-lifestyle-death-toll-nears-million.html", "title": "Putin Wages War on Vodka as Lifestyle Death Toll Mounts", "updateTime": "2012-10-31 15:41:13", "content": "Putin Wages War on Vodka as Lifestyle Death Toll Mounts\nBy Henry Meyer and Stepan Kravchenko - 2012-10-31T12:14:53Z\nVladimir Putin is waging the biggest public health drive since former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev failed to wean his country off alcohol abuse with a crackdown on tobacco and drink.\nAn anti-tobacco law submitted to parliament yesterday will ban smoking in public places, advertising and kiosk sales. That follows measures to curb the world\u2019s fourth-highest alcohol consumption per capita with tax increases and by limiting trade.\nSmoking and drinking kill 900,000 people a year in Russia, the world\u2019s second-largest market for cigarettes and alcohol, according to official estimates. The country\u2019s population of 143 million is about 5 million less than in 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed. Alcohol and tobacco abuse costs the Russian economy at least $104 billion a year, or 5 percent of gross domestic product, the government estimates.\n\u201cPutin has set himself the goal of reversing the population decline through encouraging a more healthy lifestyle,\u201d said Sergei Markov , a former lawmaker in the ruling United Russia party and vice-rector of the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics in Moscow. \u201cBut if you look at our history, Gorbachev wasn\u2019t successful in that.\u201d\n$1 Vodka\nThe crackdown risks encouraging Russians to seek counterfeit cigarettes and drinks, according to tobacco companies and alcohol industry analysts. Illegal sales of vodka -- which is priced as little as $1 for a half-liter (0.13 gallon) -- will rise to 60 percent from 35 percent of the market by 2014, according to the Center for Federal and Regional Alcohol Market Studies . Illicit tobacco trade may expand to 40 percent of the market from 1 percent, the lobby group Tabakprom estimates.\nPrime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Oct. 16 railed at Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) , British American Tobacco Plc (BATS) , Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) and Imperial Tobacco Group (IMT) , blaming them for addicting millions of children and women to cigarettes since the early 1990s. The four companies control 93 percent of the $19.5- billion Russian tobacco market. Thirty-nine percent of Russians smoke regularly, according to the World Health Organization .\nFive foreign-owned companies hold more than 80 percent of the beer market in Russia -- Baltika Breweries, part of Carlsberg A/S (CARLA) , Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) , Heineken NV (HEIA) , Andalou Efes Biracilik & Malt Sanayii AS and SABMiller Plc. (SAB) The alcohol market in Russia, which is 24 percent vodka and 51 percent beer, is worth $34.4 billion according to Euromonitor, a consumer research company.\nSlumping Shares\nImperial, the maker of Davidoff cigarettes, retreated 0.9 percent to 2,349 pence at 12:07 p.m. in London. Japan Tobacco shares fell 1.5 percent to 2,206 yen at the close in Tokyo trading. AB InBev, the maker of Budweiser and Stella Artois , slid as much as 1.5 percent in Brussels while Carlsberg fell the most in three months in Copenhagen trading, dropping as much as 3.8 percent.\nThe Russian government will insist that the anti-smoking draft bill submitted yesterday be approved in its current form, said Alexei Levchenko, an aide to Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets, who\u2019s responsible for health and social affairs.\n\u2018Serious\u2019 Increase\nThe Finance Ministry is also due to respond at the start of November to the government\u2019s proposal for a \u201cserious\u201d increase in tobacco excise taxes, Levchenko said by phone from Moscow today.\nRussian vodka sales will decline 4 percent by 2016 and beer sales will remain stagnant over the period, Euromonitor predicts. Russia this year increased the minimum price of a half-liter of vodka to 125 rubles ($4) and plans to raise it  to 200 rubles by 2015, according to the government daily, Rossiiskaya Gazeta. Beer duties were increased threefold in 2010 and will be six times higher in 2015 than in 2009.\nThe Health Ministry says smoking levels may be cut in half as a result of the anti-tobacco law and planned tax increases for cigarettes in Russia, where a pack of Marlboros sells for about $2. The aim is to bring prices to European levels by 2015.\nRussia cut alcohol consumption to 15 liters (4 gallons) from 18 liters per capita in the last two years, Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov said in December. The government wants to reduce it to at least 8 liters by 2020, the WHO\u2019s accepted consumption level.\n\u2018Hooks People\u2019\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t banning people from smoking or drinking,\u201d Deputy Health Minister Sergei Velmyaikin said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re just implementing a package of measures to stop extremely aggressive marketing which hooks people on very harmful products.\u201d\nGorbachev, who came to power in 1985, started an anti- alcohol campaign that cut the production of vodka and other spirits by as much as 40 percent within a year, uprooted vineyards, restricted sales and increased prices. Russians compensated by producing \u201csamogon\u201d or moonshine at home, according to a study last year by Stanford University .\nThe campaign ended in 1988 after eroding Gorbachev\u2019s popularity and spawning a series of jokes about him. Yeltsin, who was known for appearing drunk in public, stepped down in 1999, nominating Putin, a non-smoking judo black belt, as his successor.\nThe government last year banned alcohol sales between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m., as well as drinking alcohol in public places. In July, it outlawed beer advertising on television, radio, billboards and Internet and from January 1, kiosks won\u2019t be able to sell beer.\nThe average Russian, including women and youths, drank 77 liters (20.3 gallons) of beer, 9 liters of spirit and 7 liters of wine in 2011, Euromonitor data shows. One in five Russian men die from harmful use of alcohol, the Geneva-based WHO says.\n\u201cWe are used to smoking, drinking, eating a poor diet and doing little sport and then falling ill, and expect to be operated on or take pills to get better,\u201d Nikolai Gerasimenko, deputy head of the lower house of parliament\u2019s health committee, said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s got to stop.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.net ; Stepan Kravchenko in Moscow at skravchenko@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Balazs Penz at bpenz@bloomberg.net\nPutin Wages War on Vodka as Lifestyle Death Toll Nears Million\nDmitry Beliakov/Bloomberg\nMen drink vodka in a cafe in Moscow.

Sales of more expensive beers enabled the brewer to boost total revenue more than estimated.\nThe maker of Budweiser said the pace of volume growth in Brazil, one of its biggest regions, slowed from the second quarter and its dominant share of the market shrank about 1.1 percentage points from a year earlier as it increased prices to coincide with a proposed tax increase. The quantity of beer sold in Europe declined, led by a 17 percent drop in Russia amid a \u201cdeclining industry and challenging regulatory environment.\u201d\nToday\u2019s results are \u201ca mixed bag,\u201d Jonathan Fyfe, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities LLP in London , wrote in a note.\nWhile an 11 percent increase in organic earnings before interest, tax, amortization and depreciation beat estimates, earnings per share growth fell short.\nSo-called normalized earnings before interest, tax, amortization and depreciation rose 0.3 percent to $3.98 billion. On an organic basis, that was an increase of 11 percent, compared with the median analyst estimate of 8.7 percent growth.\nShares Decline\nNormalized earnings per share rose to $1.17 from $1.09 in the quarter, missing the $1.21 median estimate, because of higher-than-expected finance charges, according to Anthony Bucalo, an analyst at Banco Santander SA in London.\nAB InBev shares slid as much as 1.5 percent, and traded down 0.9 percent at 65.71 euros as of 11:42 a.m. in Brussels. They had risen 40 percent this year before today, outpacing gains in competitors SABMiller Plc (SAB) , Carlsberg A/S (CARLA) and Heineken NV. (HEIA) Carlsberg, the owner of Russia\u2019s biggest brewer, declined as much as 3.8 percent to 487.50 kroner in Copenhagen today.\nThe unexpected decline in AB InBev\u2019s volume followed a 0.1 percent drop in the second quarter after it adjusted the pace and timing of deliveries in the U.S. to wholesalers.\nTotal organic sales rose 9.1 percent in the third quarter, topping the median analyst estimate of 7.5 percent. Revenue rose to $10.3 billion from $10.2 billion a year earlier.\nLime-A-Rita\nIn the U.S., the introduction of higher-priced products such as Bud Light Platinum and Lime-A-Rita led to a 5.7 percent gain in revenue per hectoliter, the company said. Increased costs of marketing and distribution to support new products meant normalized Ebitda as a percentage of sales shrank 2.22 percentage points to 42.2 percent in the North America region.\n\u201cWe feel pleased about the performance in the U.S. and see the brands moving in the right direction,\u201d Felipe Dutra, AB InBev\u2019s chief financial officer, said on a call, even as the performance of its Budweiser brand disappointed in the quarter.\nBeer revenue per hectoliter rose 18 percent in Brazil after the company brought forward price increases to the third quarter from the fourth quarter. The decision followed a change in excise taxes that was due to take effect on Oct. 1. Selling volume in the country edged up 0.2 percent and should be higher for the year as a whole, AB InBev said.\nA partial postponement of the tax increase has led AB InBev to scale back price increases for the remainder of 2012, it said, adding that it anticipates beer-revenue-per-hectoliter growth in the \u201chigh single-digits\u201d in Brazil this year.\nModelo Acquisition\nVolume fell 0.6 percent in western Europe and 14 percent in central and eastern European on a \u201cdeclining and challenging regulatory environment, especially in Russia,\u201d AB InBev said. The brewer is \u201cstill committed\u201d to Russia, although \u201cwe see the industry declining this year, and we\u2019re not too optimistic,\u201d Dutra said.\nAB InBev expects to complete the $20 billion acquisition of the rest of Mexican partner Grupo Modelo SAB in the first quarter of 2013, Dutra said on the call. AB InBev shares fell earlier this month after website TheCapitolForum reported that the U.S. Department of Justice may want to block the deal.\n\u201cGiven the size and profile of this transaction, I do expect the DOJ to be very diligent on this analysis,\u201d Dutra said. \u201cWe believe the transaction should be approved.\u201d\nAB InBev sees revenue per hectoliter increasing ahead of inflation, and expects the cost of sales to increase in \u201cmid- single digits\u201d as it mitigates rising commodity costs with more efficient purchasing.

Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar, Brazil \u2019s biggest retailer, is trading at the most expensive level in 12 years relative to the benchmark stock index as government stimulus fuels consumer demand.\nPao de Acucar, which soared 39 percent in Sao Paulo this year before today, trades at 3 times the value of its net assets, up from 2.3 times at the start of 2012. That\u2019s the highest valuation since September 2000 relative to the Bovespa index, whose companies trade at an average price-to-book ratio of 1.2, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff is seeking to fuel economic growth by cutting taxes on consumer goods , interest rates on loans and by demanding that banks, power companies and phone operators reduce prices. While the measures are eroding the value of financial and utility stocks, they have been a boon for companies from Pao de Acucar to Lojas Americanas SA (LAME4) as retail sales surged 10 percent in the year through August.\n\u201cPeople are looking for places to hide from government intervention and China slowing, and the consumer names in Brazil tend to have a higher earnings visibility,\u201d Samir Patel, who helps oversee more than $800 million at Hermes Emerging Markets , said in a telephone interview from London . \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s really driving this valuation.\u201d\nPao de Acucar was little changed at 93.11 reais at 12:11 p.m. in Sao Paulo while the Bovespa declined 0.8 percent.\nConsumer Staples\nConsumer-goods companies are among the best performers in Brazil this year. The MSCI Brazil/Consumer Staples (MXBR0CS) index of eight stocks including Pao de Acucar advanceed 13 percent before today, compared with a 1.6 increase for the Bovespa. Consumer- health products manufacturer Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3) rallied 89 percent, and pharmacy chain Raia Drogasil SA rose 74 percent.\nPao de Acucar, which is controlled by France \u2019s Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA, has the most expensive price-to-book ratio among Latin American food retailers and wholesalers, and the stock is nearing the average 12-month target price, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Pao de Acucar fell 0.4 percent yesterday to close at 93.10 reais.\n\u201cObviously the low-hanging fruits are gone,\u201d Eric Conrads, who helps oversee $750 million in Latin American equities including Pao de Acucar shares for ING Groep NV, said in a telephone interview from New York . \u201cThe good rally is probably done, but it doesn\u2019t mean the name is not attractive on a fundamental basis looking forward.\u201d\nA press official at Pao de Acucar\u2019s Sao Paulo headquarters declined to comment.\nAnalyst Ratings\nTwelve out of 22 analysts who cover Pao de Acucar, which operates supermarkets and Ponto Frio stores selling electronics and appliances, recommend buying the shares, making it the highest-rated consumer-staple stock on the Bovespa index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u201cPao de Acucar was favored by the markets because it has some defensive characteristics associated with the strength of domestic consumption, like stability of revenue,\u201d Ricardo Correa, an analyst at Rio de Janeiro-based Ativa Corretora, said by phone. \u201cThe rally is close to exhaustion in the short term, but the scenario is still looking very healthy.\u201d\nBrazil\u2019s central bank has cut interest rates by 5.25 percentage points since August 2011 to a record low of 7.25 percent, the biggest reduction of any Group of 20 nation.

He said sales waned before the country\u2019s once-a-decade power shift, which gets under way with a Communist Party congress starting Nov. 8 in Beijing.\n\u201cThey\u2019re waiting on the new government in China, so our Chinese orders were down this year from last year,\u201d Flynn said at the National Business Aviation Association conference in Orlando , Florida . \u201cThe new government gets installed, people go back to normal business, you\u2019ll see more orders out of China.\u201d\nGulfstream\u2019s role as a producer of private jets such as the long-range G650 gives it a perspective on plane sales inside and outside the U.S. Official support for corporate aviation in China will help the industry expand more quickly in the world\u2019s most-populous country, Flynn said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re importing airplanes as fast as they can. They\u2019re building airports as fast as they can. And the restrictions have been lessened,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cI see that trend continuing. They\u2019ve been great to work with.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not the case in India, Flynn said. India , along with Brazil , Russia and China, is one of the so-called BRIC countries where economic growth rates have outstripped those in developed markets.\nFalling Behind\n\u201cIndia does not have near the commitment that China does. The infrastructure is slower. The import process is slower,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cIndia is falling farther and farther behind.\u201d\nEmerging markets led by China will post growth in aircraft demand that outpaces the U.S. and Europe, according to a study by Honeywell International Inc. (HON) released before the business aviation conference this week. The number of jets in China will increase an average of 30 percent annually over the next five years, according to Honeywell.\nGulfstream builds planes for private buyers as well as for government uses, such as aerial reconnaissance and transportation of dignitaries. Parent General Dynamics is based in Falls Church , Virginia.\nChina, though promising, is now a difficult market in which to operate corporate jets, said Claudio Galdo Camelier, vice president of market and product strategy for Embraer SA (EMBR3) \u2019s executive jet unit. Business aircraft now are usually reserved for company owners and often fly to international destinations rather than within the country, he said.\nPilot Shortage\n\u201cIn China, general aviation is almost nonexistent,\u201d he said. \u201c There aren\u2019t very many airports where you can fly with the airplane. Lack of pilots is a big issue in China.\u201d\nThe government has stepped up its effort to build more airports and relax restrictions, such as having to file a flight plan a week in advance, he said at the conference. Embraer is based in Brazil.\nCessna is laying groundwork now to sell more planes as China\u2019s aviation market matures over time, said Scott Ernest, CEO of the company, a unit of Providence, Rhode Island-based Textron Inc. (TXT) The company signed joint venture agreements in March with Aviation Industry Corp. of China to provide aviation service and plane manufacturing in the country.\nAs part of the agreements, Cessna will build some Caravans, the company\u2019s large, propeller-driven airplane, in the U.S. and finish the interior and painting in China, he said.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to sell in China, it\u2019s a good thing to be in China,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to progress through the learning curve and we\u2019ll see where that goes down the road.\u201d\nWhile the Caravan is a workhorse plane that can land and take off in tough conditions, Chinese customers also are showing interest in Cessna\u2019s larger jets, such as the Citation Sovereign, Ernest said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of successful businesses in China and that\u2019s who we sell our product to.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Black in Orlando, Florida, at tblack@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Ed Dufner at edufner@bloomberg.net\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IBOV", "embersId": "706e388e29eef341f3f43fc9184d73a88f84ac79"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-31 12:39:28", "postDate": "2012-10-31", "author": "Crayton Harrison", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-30/oi-downgraded-by-moody-s-as-competition-regulation-affect-debt.html", "title": "Oi Rating Downgraded by Moody\u2019s on Competition, Regulation", "updateTime": "2012-10-31 15:42:46", "content": "Oi Rating Downgraded by Moody\u2019s on Competition, Regulation\nBy Crayton Harrison - 2012-10-31T16:39:28Z\nOi SA (OIBR4) \u2019s credit rating was lowered by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, which said intensifying competition and regulatory pressure will delay attempts by Brazil\u2019s largest phone company to reduce debt.\nMoody\u2019s reduced Oi one level to Baa3, the lowest investment-grade rating, according to a statement yesterday.

For the \u201csake of legal certainty and transparency it is vital to distinguish between the phases where the shareholders of an institution are still in full control\u201d and the phase \u201cwhere control is seized by the resolution authority,\u201d according to the report.\nMichel Barnier, the EU\u2019s financial services chief, has called for sweeping powers for regulators to take control of failing banks and write down their creditors as part of a push to take taxpayers off the hook for rescues. His plans must be approved by governments and by lawmakers in the parliament before they can take effect.\nBarnier\u2019s proposal for writing down unsecured creditors may \u201cincrease systemic risk and give market participants incentives to start a bank run\u201d unless it includes safeguards, according to Hoekmark\u2019s report.\nTo counter this, debt with an original maturity of six months or less should be excluded from the measures, according to the report.\nHoekmark also calls for the EU to partly scrap proposals that would force nations to set up bank-financed funds that would stabilize lenders in crisis, and that would lend to each other as a last resort.\nWhile banks should be required to pay a fee to governments to cover the cost of bank rescue efforts, this money shouldn\u2019t have to go into a specific fund, according to the report. Nations should only be required to assist each other in stabilizing a bank if the lender has cross-border operations, Hoekmark argues.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jim Brunsden in Brussels at jbrunsden@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anthony Aarons at aaarons@bloomberg.net\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IBOV", "embersId": "bdb37400246bae5fe7bc74584102a9a3f3396d69"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-30 10:34:19", "postDate": "2012-10-30", "author": "Charles Penty , Sharon Smyth", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-29/spain-sets-discount-for-bad-bank-assets-seeks-private-investors.html", "title": "Spain Sets Discount for Bad Bank Assets, Seeks Investors", "updateTime": "2012-10-31 15:43:05", "content": "Spain Sets Discount for Bad Bank Assets, Seeks Investors\nBy Charles Penty and Sharon Smyth - 2012-10-30T14:34:19Z\nSpain \u2019s bad bank will buy foreclosed real estate assets at an average discount of 63 percent as the state seeks investors to become shareholders in the 60 billion- euro ($77 billion) facility, the bank-rescue fund said.\nThe bad bank, known as SAREB, will apply an average discount of 46 percent to gross book value on loans to developers, the so-called FROB rescue fund said in a presentation yesterday in Madrid. Nationalized lenders will transfer 45 billion euros of assets to the bad bank, while other lenders with capital shortfalls may transfer about 15 billion euros, FROB Chairman Fernando Restoy said.\nSpain is setting up the bad bank, a mechanism also used in Ireland, to help lenders that receive state aid sell real estate that has plunged in value. The creation of the vehicle is a condition of a European bailout of as much as 100 billion euros for Spain\u2019s banking industry agreed to in July. The transfer values shouldn\u2019t be a \u201creference\u201d for the property held on the books of the rest of the banking industry, Restoy said.\n\u201cA positive sign would be if we see an investor come in after they\u2019ve run the rule over the valuations and determine that there could be a return on these assets at these discounts,\u201d said Daragh Quinn, an analyst at Nomura International Plc. in Madrid . \u201cThey could be right or they could be wrong but it would send a positive message.\u201d\n\u2018Conservative\u2019 Estimate\nSpain will discuss the planned structure of the bad bank with potential investors in coming days. The government aims to keep its stake in the entity below 50 percent to avoid including it in national accounts, Restoy said. The vehicle, which will exist for as long as 15 years, will be profitable, with a 14 percent to 15 percent annual return on equity as a \u201cconservative\u201d estimate, he said.\n\u201cFor foreclosed assets, the transfer prices seem reasonable but on the loans side they haven\u2019t been tough enough and this will mean the vehicle will generate losses,\u201d said Mikel Echavarren, chief executive officer of Irea, a Madrid- based financial adviser.\nForeclosed Land\nEchavarren said he was also skeptical about the estimates given for the possible future return for the vehicle, whose equity will be equivalent to about 8 percent of total assets.\n\u201cHow can they predict that?\u201d Echavarren said in a phone interview. \u201cTo make a 15-year business plan in Spain on the real estate sector today, not even God could do that.\u201d\nThe discounts include reductions of as much as 80 percent for foreclosed land, 63 percent for foreclosed unfinished housing developments and 32 percent for loans to finance finished apartments, according to the FROB.\nIt may be too early for investors to decide whether they\u2019ll put money into the bad bank because details of the assets to be transferred to it are still too scant, said Simon Martin, head of research and strategy at Tristan Capital Partners, a real estate investment company in London with 3 billion euros of assets under management.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t much to go on at this stage,\u201d said Martin. \u201cIt\u2019s sparse on detail so I\u2019d say it\u2019s a step forward but for us to draw conclusions we would need a lot more detail on the quality and location of what is going in.\u201d\nStress Test\nThe starting point for the valuations is the base-case scenario in a stress test carried out by consulting firm Oliver Wyman, with an additional discount added, FROB said.\nGovernment decrees in February and May ordering banks to recognize a combined 84 billion euros of losses on real estate had raised coverage levels for those assets to 45 percent. The stress test by Oliver Wyman published Sept. 28 said seven Spanish lenders had a combined capital deficit of 59.3 billion euros in an adverse economic scenario.\nThe discounts being applied by the bad bank look similar to those being set in the adverse economic scenario in the Oliver Wyman stress test, said Owen Callan, an analyst at Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) in Dublin.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019ve lowballed it,\u201d he said.\nIt may prove hard to find private investors to put money into the bad bank, Andrea Filtri and Andres Williams, analysts at Mediobanca SpA in London, said in a note, adding that the government may ask Spanish lenders to \u201cfoot the bill.\u201d\n\u2018Transfer Risk\u2019\n\u201cThis would trigger an infra-sector transfer risk, defeating the purpose of the bad bank in the first place,\u201d they said. The bad bank \u201chelps but it is not an oversized cushion,\u201d they said, pointing out that it copes with currently recognized problem loans but doesn\u2019t cover impairments that aren\u2019t linked to real estate.\nTransferring real estate assets to the bad bank will reduce the capital needs of lenders by 5 billion euros to 6 billion euros, Restoy said.\nBanks including Banco Santander SA (SAN) , the biggest lender in Spain, have expressed concern about the impact that the transfer prices imposed for the bad bank could have on their assets as they book provisions for their own real estate.\n\u201cWhat worries us is the possible relations between transfer pricing to the bad bank and the prices at which we have valued our assets once we have covered the provisions from the royal decrees,\u201d Santander CEO Alfredo Saenz told analysts in an Oct. 25 webcast.\n\u2018Higher Discount\u2019\n\u201cThe market will always try to make the read across and will conclude that the banks should be holding these assets at the higher discount,\u201d Antonio Ramirez , an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Ltd. in London, said in a phone interview. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like the regulator will force the banks to take additional haircuts.\u201d\nThe Bankia group will transfer 38 billion euros in real estate loans and 12 billion euros of foreclosed assets by gross value to the bad bank, FROB Director General Antonio Carrascosa said at a news conference in Madrid.\nSome lenders are stepping up efforts to dispose of real estate assets before the bad bank comes into effect.\nSantander said Oct. 25 it reduced its stock of foreclosed real estate assets for a second quarter in a row as the gross amount held on its books slipped to 8.3 billion euros from a peak of 8.6 billion euros in March.\nBanco Sabadell SA (SAB) , a Catalan lender, said the same day it sold 708 million euros of real estate in the first nine months of the year as it applied discounts of as much as 50 percent on assets such as holiday apartment complexes that it owns.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Charles Penty in Madrid  at cpenty@bloomberg.net ; Sharon Smyth in Madrid  at ssmyth2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Frank Connelly at fconnelly@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IBOV", "embersId": "d41a7b3021372a2d0b5112073be900e668154700"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-30 08:04:53", "postDate": "2012-10-30", "author": "Scott Hamilton", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-30/u-k-banks-can-tap-66-billion-pounds-in-fls-plan-boe-data-show.html", "title": "NAB\u2019s Clydesdale Joins Bank of England FLS as Total Rises to 30", "updateTime": "2012-10-31 15:43:07", "content": "NAB\u2019s Clydesdale Joins Bank of England FLS as Total Rises to 30\nBy Scott Hamilton - 2012-10-30T12:04:53Z\nNational Australia Bank Ltd.

Based on FLS rules allowing banks to borrow 5 percent of their stocks of loans, that means they can tap the Bank of England for an initial 66.3 billion pounds.\nClydesdale, based in Glasgow, was the largest new lender in the FLS, with loans of 33.2 billion pounds. The second biggest was Co-Operative Bank Plc, with 31.8 billion pounds. The new total compares with data on Sept. 25 showing 13 banks with loans of 1.21 trillion pounds had signed up. The Bank of England published today\u2019s list after processing more applications.\nThe program, designed with the U.K. Treasury, allows banks to borrow at cheaper rates for as long as four years. It is aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing and is the latest in a series of measures introduced to help the economy fend off contagion from the turmoil in the euro area. Banks have been able to borrow treasury bills from the Bank of England since Aug. 1, and the central bank had said its new lending plan could boost credit to companies and households by at least 80 billion pounds.\nUnder the FLS, a bank can initially borrow treasury bills valued at 5 percent of outstanding loans, plus any expansion of lending during a reference period from that date to end-2013.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Scott Hamilton in London at shamilton8@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Craig Stirling at cstirling1@bloomberg.net\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "IBOV", "embersId": "acfc3ed6fe918a35ba8eec07fca95a540b7a3893"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-29 19:00:01", "postDate": "2012-10-29", "author": "Jim Brunsden", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-29/banks-should-give-more-data-on-basel-stress-tests-fsb-says.html", "title": "Banks Should Give More Data on Basel, Stress Tests, FSB Says", "updateTime": "2012-10-31 15:43:08", "content": "Banks Should Give More Data on Basel, Stress Tests, FSB Says\nBy Jim Brunsden - 2012-10-29T23:00:01Z\nBanks should increase the data they disclose to investors on how well they measure up to Basel capital rules and on their performance in internal stress tests, according to global regulators.\nSupervisors at the Financial Stability Board also called for lenders to disclose all off-balance sheet commitments, as part of a push to curb banks\u2019 risk taking.\n\u201cRebuilding investors\u2019 confidence and trust in the banking industry is vital to the future health of the financial system,\u201d an FSB task force said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.

The prediction is 1 million tons lower than forecast by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The most widely held option on the Chicago Board of Trade gives holders the right to buy the grain for delivery in December at $10 a bushel, or 16 percent more than now, bourse data show.\nA lack of rain is also curbing corn and soybean harvests, driving futures to records and contributing to the highest global food costs in six months, United Nations data show. Countries will spend more than $1 trillion on food imports for a third year in 2012, the UN estimates. Wheat surged 33 percent this year, the most since 2007, after dry weather in the U.S., Europe and Australia. The USDA expects worldwide exports to drop 16 percent, the biggest decline since 1986.\n\u201cThe rain didn\u2019t come until late,\u201d said Maitland Davey, a 69-year-old who farms 3,700 acres northeast of Perth, the capital of Australia\u2019s biggest exporting state. \u201cI hate ripping that ground up dry, dust just flying everywhere,\u201d he said, predicting a 30 percent decline in his harvest this year.\nFood Grain\nWheat traded at $8.645 on the Chicago Board of Trade today and averaged $7.405 this year. Futures may climb 7.5 percent to $9.30 by the end of 2012, the median of 16 trader and analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows. The Standard & Poor\u2019s GSCI Agriculture index of eight commodities rose 11 percent this year and the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities gained 10 percent. Treasuries returned 1.9 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.\nGlobal wheat production will drop 6.1 percent to 653.1 million tons this marketing year, steeper than the 2.5 percent decline in demand to 678.2 million tons, the USDA estimates. That will reduce stockpiles by 13 percent to 173 million tons, the smallest since 2009, the agency says. The London-based International Grains Council said Oct. 25 that combined grain stockpiles in the largest exporters will drop to a 17-year low .\nLivestock Farmers\nThe USDA\u2019s estimates may still be too optimistic. While the Washington-based agency expects Australian output to be 23 million tons, the median in a Bloomberg survey of six analysts and traders was 20.8 million tons, implying a decline of 30 percent on a year earlier and the lowest since 2008.\nSurging prices may curb consumption more than the USDA anticipates. Demand contracted 3.5 percent in 2004 after futures advanced for four consecutive years. Livestock farmers, who use wheat in feed, are accelerating slaughter rates because the jump in grain prices eroded margins. U.S. pork inventories on Sept. 30 were the highest for the period since the USDA started compiling the data in 1915.\nFarmers historically have responded to rallies by planting more crops the following season. Wheat production expanded almost 12 percent in 2009 after prices reached a record $13.495 the previous year, USDA data show. Sowing in the U.S., the world\u2019s biggest exporter, is set to increase 1.9 percent to 56.81 million acres, Memphis , Tennessee-based Informa Economics Inc. said in a report Oct. 19.\nGrain Stockpiles\nGlobal food prices are still 9.3 percent below the record set in February 2011, UN data show. Prices have been curbed in part by a glut of sugar and by abundant rice supplies, a staple for half the world. Stockpiles of the grain will rise 6 percent to a record , the UN estimates. That\u2019s preventing another global food crisis and keeping wheat below $10, said Wayne Gordon, an agricultural strategist at UBS AG in New York.\nWhile rising corn and wheat prices \u201cwill affect our pet care business,\u201d overall increases in Nestle SA (NESN) \u2019s agricultural raw-material costs should be in the \u201clow to mid-single digit\u201d this year, Chief Financial Officer Wan Ling Martello told investors at a Shanghai conference Oct. 18. The world\u2019s biggest food company made 12 percent of its sales in pet care last year.\nHedge funds and other large speculators are holding a net- long position, or bets on higher prices of 55,269 futures and options, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. That\u2019s more than eight times the average over the past five years. Futures traders are also anticipating higher prices, with grain for delivery in May now trading at a 2.5 percent premium to the December contract, from a discount of 5.8 percent in July.\nBiggest Exporter\nThat reflects mounting concern about crops in Australia, where the harvest began this month, and in Argentina , where farmers usually start cutting grain next month. The South American nation, the sixth-biggest exporter, will produce 16 percent less this season, the government said Oct. 18.\nDeclining supply in Australia is driving domestic prices higher, with a 47 percent gain this year to A$330 ($343) a ton in Western Australia. That makes it one of the world\u2019s most expensive varieties, according to Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) in Sydney.\nShipments from the former Soviet Union may drop 48 percent this season as drought damaged crops, the USDA predicts. Exports from Russia may \u201cpractically halt\u201d in the second half of the marketing year, the USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service said in its monthly outlook . Ukraine will soon exhaust its exportable supplies, making a formal ban \u201cirrelevant,\u201d said Mathews. Both nations limited sales in 2010 after droughts.\nWinter Dormancy\nThe effects of the worst U.S. drought since 1956 are still being felt in the winter wheat crop, which is usually planted in September and October. About 49 percent of plants had emerged by Oct. 21, compared with a five-year average of 56 percent, the government estimates. That may make the shoots vulnerable to damage going into winter dormancy, said Mathews.\nInventories of wheat in North America, the 27-nation European Union, the Black Sea region, Australia and Argentina will drop to 36 percent of global trade, from 53 percent a year earlier, according to Paul Deane, an agricultural economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) in Melbourne .\n\u201cThe Australian situation could exacerbate the tightness,\u201d said Deane. \u201cHalf way through the marketing year both East Coast and South Australia could have pretty much exhausted what they had available to export.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Luzi Ann Javier in Singapore at ljavier@bloomberg.net ; Phoebe Sedgman in Melbourne at psedgman2@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Poole at jpoole4@bloomberg.net\nAustralian Wheat Exports Plunging Most in Six Years\nCarla Gottgens/Bloomberg\nA lack of rain is also curbing corn and soybean harvests, driving futures to records and contributing to the highest global food costs in six months, United Nations data show.\nA lack of rain is also curbing corn and soybean harvests, driving futures to records and contributing to the highest global food costs in six months, United Nations data show.

(AAPL) dropped 0.9 percent after Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook embarked on a sweeping management overhaul at the world\u2019s most valuable company. Home Depot Inc. (HD) and Lowe\u2019s Cos. added at least 2.2 percent amid speculation the home- improvement retailers would be helped by spending related to the storm. General Motors Co. rallied 9.2 percent after reporting third-quarter profit that surpassed analysts\u2019 estimates.\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent from Friday\u2019s close to 1,413.91 at 3:16 p.m. in New York, after falling as much as 0.4 percent. The gauge has declined 1.9 percent in October after four straight months of gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 3.42 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 13,110.63 today. Trading on the S&P 500 was in line with the 30-day average during this time of the day.\n\u201cToday, traders are more heightened to a flash crash more than any day prior,\u201d Rick Fier, director of equity trading at Conifer Securities LLC in New York, said in a phone interview. His firm oversees $8 billion in assets. \u201cNobody cares about if the market goes up or down. You just want to make sure the market is functioning properly. With the better opening, it made the decision to sell that much easier.\u201d\nAmerican equity markets were closed Oct. 29 and yesterday, the first consecutive shutdowns because of weather in more than a century. The decision to open U.S. markets was announced in statements by NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and Bats Global Markets Inc.\n\u2018Very Smoothly\u2019\nThe New York Stock Exchange opened its market on time by running on backup power from generators. Brokers on the NYSE floor experienced limited Internet and mobile-phone connections while still being able to trade from the exchange.\nTrading went \u201cvery smoothly, everything opened fairly quickly,\u201d Duncan Niederauer, the chief executive officer of NYSE Euronext, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television\u2019s Matt Miller. \u201cParticipation has been a lot more active than we thought,\u201d he said. \u201cFor some it was business as usual, for some they were using their backup sites.\u201d\nKnight Capital Group Inc. (KCG) , one of the largest U.S. market makers, shut down trading of equities after backup power failed at its headquarters in Jersey City, New Jersey, amid a blackout following the storm. No new orders for stock trades are being accepted, according to a memo from Knight, which almost went bankrupt in August after a computer error flooded the market with unintended transactions. The stock slid 3.1 percent to $2.54.\nPower Issues\n\u201cDue to a building emergency (power issues), Knight Capital Americas is asking you to seek an alternate destination for the order handling and execution of your OTC, Options and Listed orders until further notice,\u201d said the memo, which was confirmed by spokeswoman Kara Fitzsimmons. \u201cAll computer interfaces with Knight will be shut down with no new orders, both by phone or electronic, being accepted at this time.\u201d\nThe longest weather-related U.S. trading suspension in 124 years has left money managers with one day instead of three to adjust their holdings before the fiscal year ends for more than 20 percent of them.\nThe closure of American exchanges during Hurricane Sandy occurred during the last week of the fiscal year for 1,521 U.S. mutual funds, according to data compiled by Morningstar Inc. With two days lost, demand from managers who want to buy and sell shares for tax and performance reasons may surge today, said Donald Selkin of New York-based National Securities Corp.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much they\u2019ve done already,\u201d Selkin, the chief market strategist at National Securities, which manages about $3 billion, said in a phone interview from his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. \u201cThat could be the wild card -- how much they have to cram in.\u201d\nEconomic Reports\nA business activity gauge from the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. increased to 49.9 this month from 49.7 in September. A reading of 50 is the dividing line between expansion and contraction. The median estimate of 54 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast it would rise to 51.\nThe Labor Department will issue its monthly employment report for October as scheduled on Nov. 2, a spokesman said today. Payrolls increased by 125,000 workers in October and the jobless rate rose to 7.9 percent, according to the median forecasts of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\nPresidential Election\nThe jobs report is the last before the Nov. 6 presidential election, and may help sway voters trying to decide between giving President Barack Obama another four years in office or to change course with Republican challenger Mitt Romney .\nADP Employer Services, which is scheduled to release its monthly employment data tomorrow, revised its September result to an increase of 88,200 jobs from 162,000, based on a new methodology. Economists estimate companies added 135,000 jobs this month, according to a Bloomberg News survey.\nInvestors are also watching corporate results. Some 24 companies in the S&P 500 are due to report earnings today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit has exceeded projections at 72 percent of companies to have released third- quarter results, while sales trailed estimates at 60 percent of firms, Bloomberg data show.\nHurricane Sandy may reduce economic output by $25 billion in the fourth quarter, according to Gregory Daco, a U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. That could lower the fourth-quarter pace of growth to between 1 percent and 1.5 percent, from an estimate of 1.6 percent, he said.\nApple Declines\nHealth-care, energy and technology companies fell the most among 10 S&P 500 industry groups, sinking at least 0.5 percent. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.5 percent to the lowest level since Aug. 3 on a closing basis.\nApple fell 0.9 percent to $598.50 on the first trading session since Apple announced the departure of mobile software head Scott Forstall and retail leader John Browett.\nHome Depot, the largest U.S. home-improvement retailer, climbed 2.2 percent to $61.36, while Lowe\u2019s rose 3 percent to $32.30.\nGeneral Motors (GM) rallied 9.2 percent to $25.42. The largest U.S. automaker reported a third-quarter profit that surpassed analysts\u2019 estimates by more than 50 percent and said it wants to break even in Europe by mid-decade.\nFord Motor Co. (F) advanced 6.7 percent to $11.01. The second- largest U.S. automaker reported its 14th consecutive profitable quarter as its North America unit delivered record earnings that made up for higher taxes and losses in Europe.\nQuanta Services\nQuanta Services Inc. (PWR) , the biggest U.S. power line contractor, rose 10 percent to $25.97 as earnings beat expectations and damage from Sandy brought the company more work.\nGenworth Financial Inc. (GNW) climbed 8.2 percent to $5.93. The insurer beat third-quarter estimates and posted a narrower loss at the unit backing home loans. Acting Chief Executive Officer Martin Klein said the company plans to sell businesses to raise funds that can be used to cut debt and buy back shares.\nWestern Union Co. (WU) , the world\u2019s biggest money-transfer business, plunged 29 percent to $12.82 after cutting its profit forecast for 2013.\nWalt Disney Co. (DIS) slipped 2.2 percent to $48.99. The world\u2019s largest theme-park company agreed to buy George Lucas\u2019s Lucasfilm Ltd. for $4.05 billion in cash and stock, adding \u201cStar Wars\u201d and \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d to its roster of movies. The first of a new trilogy of \u201cStar Wars\u201d films will be released in 2015, Disney said.\nMore Acquisitions\nOpnet Technologies Inc. (OPNT) jumped 29 percent to $41.50. Riverbed Technology Inc. (RVBD) announced on Oct. 29 that it agreed to acquire the software-products company in a transaction with an equity value of $1 billion, expanding its offerings to help businesses manage computer networks. Riverbed, the maker of computer-networking products, slipped 19 percent to $18.38.\nPVH Corp. (PVH) surged 18 percent to $108.03. The owner of the Tommy Hilfiger brand, agreed to buy Warnaco Group in a $2.9 billion transaction, creating a company with $8 billion in sales and bringing all Calvin Klein-branded apparel under one roof in the biggest clothing-industry deal announced this year. Shares of Warnaco soared 38 percent to $70.22.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Inyoung Hwang in New York at ihwang7@bloomberg.net ; Lu Wang in New York at lwang8@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net\n5:14\nOct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Terrence Duffy, executive chairman of CME Group Inc., talks about the resumption of regular trading hours after U.S. equity markets shut down for two days due to superstorm Sandy.

Their recipe: a combination of spending cuts and foreign-investment liberalization that amounts to the biggest policy overhaul in a decade.\nWith growth approaching its weakest pace in three years, the rupee sliding to a record low, one of the nation\u2019s largest private air carriers teetering toward bankruptcy, and elections due within 18 months, the ruling Congress party was ready to back steps opposed by coalition allies, ministers and party leaders said on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. Their prescription for resetting India\u2019s economy will face its first test when parliament reconvenes this month.\n\u201cThe government has won the first battle but it hasn\u2019t won the war,\u201d said Satish Misra, a political analyst at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi who has been following Indian politics for three decades. \u201cIn the next session of parliament the opposition will start its fight-back with all its sound and fury.\u201d\nNo-Confidence Vote\nTo bolster the government before the legislative debates, Singh on Oct. 28 replaced about a third of his ministers, drafting in younger lawmakers as he aimed to repair the reputation of an administration tainted by corruption scandals over the past two years.\nOpposition parties are threatening a no-confidence vote when parliament meets for the winter session scheduled to begin on Nov. 22. Two smaller regional parties, in protest over the changes, have bolted the Congress-led coalition, which was already reliant on outside support to survive.\nMayawati, the leader of the fourth-largest party in India\u2019s parliament, declined to say last month whether her Bahujan Samaj Party would continue to back the government. The Samajwadi Party, the third largest in parliament, has signaled it will continue outside support for the coalition while opposing the economic overhaul.\nFirst Barometer\nAs the government tries to navigate the next session of parliament, two provincial elections may provide the first barometer of how the public views Congress\u2019 bid to reassert authority ahead of national elections. Voters will go to the polls in early November in Himachal Pradesh where Congress is hoping to wrest power from the Bharatiya Janata Party , the main federal opposition party. In December, elections will be held in Gujarat where Congress is aiming to weaken the hold of the BJP.\nThe government is not backing down, saying it will enact further changes beyond those already announced in the retailing, insurance and pension industries, and in energy markets. Chidambaram, who has served two previous terms as finance minister, said in an Oct. 12 interview with Bloomberg Television that the government is planning further measures to open up the economy.\n\u201cWe intend to take some more steps on the capital market side, some more steps on insurance, banking and some more steps on the infrastructure side,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are under preparation.\u201d\nThe Oct. 4 announcement on foreign investment in insurance and pensions by Singh, who had been branded an \u201cunderachiever\u201d on the July 16 cover of Time magazine and a \u201ctragic figure\u201d in a Sept. 4 Washington Post article, propelled Indian shares to their highest close in 17 months and the rupee to its strongest level against the dollar in more than five months.\nPartnership Rekindled\nIn the year prior to the policy revamp, the rupee had declined more than 14 percent. Since the campaign began with the Sept. 13 announcement on increased diesel tariffs, it\u2019s been the second best-performing currency among emerging market nations tracked by Bloomberg, gaining 3 percent.\nChidambaram\u2019s move from the Home Ministry, where he had taken charge in the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks to oversee an overhaul of internal security, reinstated a partnership with Singh that presided over a record period of 9 percent annual growth from 2004 to 2008.\n\u201cChidambaram by becoming finance minister tipped the balance in favor of reforms,\u201d said Rasheed Kidwai, author of the book \u201cSonia: A Biography.\u201d \u201cThey might have happened anyway, but he reinforced Singh in arguing they were necessary right now.\u201d\nSonia\u2019s Fear\nIt may have also helped overcome fears in the ruling party, in particular concerns held by Sonia Gandhi that the government might collapse if its allies were pushed to the wall, said Kidwai.\nChidambaram is a \u201ctrusted counsel of Sonia Gandhi,\u201d with their relationship dating back three decades to when he was an adviser to her husband, the late former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, and later when he joined the board of a foundation set up in Rajiv\u2019s name, said Kidwai. \u201cChidambaram is able to frame the arguments in a way that Sonia will understand -- that if you have growth then you will have more money for social spending.\u201d\nSingh unveiled his policymaking drive in September after almost two years of legislative paralysis, and it included moves to allow foreign investment in multibrand retail outlets, aviation, broadcasting and power exchanges, and the decision to raise diesel prices to stem a fiscal deficit.\n\u2018Hard Decisions\u2019\nIn the second wave of policy changes at the start of October, the government announced plans to allow overseas companies to take larger stakes in insurance companies and for the first time to permit foreign investment in pension firms. Unlike the moves in retail and aviation, the changes in the pension and insurance industries require legislation that will have to be passed in parliament.\nSingh said Sept. 21 in a speech to the nation that \u201cthe time has come for hard decisions\u201d and that the new measures would spur growth, creating millions of jobs and garnering revenue for spending on health and education. To press its case, the government published a series of full-page advertisements in the country\u2019s best-selling newspapers, arguing that the decision to allow foreign retail chains like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) to hold a majority stake in ventures would benefit farmers and consumers.\nUpper Hand\nThe government\u2019s policy efforts have reversed a trend of falling inflows of overseas money, after foreign direct investment fell 33 percent in the first six months of this year. Foreign capital entering India, mostly in the form of purchases of the nation\u2019s equities, surged $5.3 billion since Singh began to roll out his policy changes, taking the year\u2019s total inflows to $18.1 billion.\n\u201cIt looks like the reformers have finally got the upper hand,\u201d said Sam Mahtani, who oversees about $5 billion of assets as director of emerging markets at F&C Asset Management Plc (FCAM) in London. \u201cThe way out for India is growth, if they can get back to seven or eight percent growth then you grow your way out of the problems. It looks like they really want to press ahead with reforms now. In a year or two years\u2019 time, we could be saying this was a turning point.\u201d\nIndia, Asia\u2019s third-largest economy, expanded 5.5 percent in the three months through June from a year earlier, close to the 5.3 percent pace of the previous quarter that was a three- year low. The central bank cut lenders\u2019 reserve requirements on Oct. 30 in a move that supports the government\u2019s policy revamp.\nSingh\u2019s U-Turn\nThe BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, has climbed 2.7 percent since mid-September, when the overhaul was first announced. The benchmark has gained 19 percent this year, the best performance among the BRIC countries, which also include Brazil, Russia and China.\nThe last time Singh\u2019s government announced a round of policy changes it ended up backtracking under pressure from its coalition allies. In December, the prime minister shelved plans to allow foreign direct investment in pension funds and the multibrand retail industry.\nNoting the political challenges facing Singh\u2019s government, Standard and Poor\u2019s said Oct. 10 that India may lose its investment-grade credit rating within the next 24 months if economic growth slows and political opposition to policy overhauls increases. Being tagged with junk status would deprive India\u2019s debt of investment by funds that avoid high-risk, high- yield securities.\nParliament Headache\nThe country faces at least a one-in-three possibility of a downgrade, S&P analysts Takahira Ogawa and Elena Okorochenko said in a note, reiterating comments made in April when the rating agency lowered India\u2019s outlook. S&P cut the country\u2019s sovereign credit outlook to negative, a step away from non- investment grade rating and the lowest in the BRIC group.\nWith some of its governing partners having quit, the 11- party Congress-led coalition now has 247 members in the 545-seat lower house of parliament. That means it needs the support of lawmakers from outside the coalition to pass legislation such as changes to allow foreign investment in pensions and insurance.\nWhile Indian opinion polls face a series of sampling difficulties that can affect their accuracy, such as the diverse caste, regional and linguistic makeup of the electorate, a poll published in August by Nielsen Holdings NV (NLSN) and India Today magazine forecast that a BJP-led bloc would win the most seats in an election.\nAccording to the survey, Singh\u2019s coalition will win 181 seats, 78 fewer than it secured in the May 2009 election, while the BJP bloc of parties may win as many as 205. The poll, conducted in July in 19 states, had 16,000 respondents and no margin of error was given.\nPolitical Risk\n\u201cWe still have to bear in mind that they have a political system they have to work with and there is a risk that they could lose power and have to call fresh elections,\u201d Mahtani said, referring to Congress\u2019 tenuous standing in parliament. \u201cIt is a fairly fine balancing act. The worst case scenario is they have to backtrack.\u201d\nSingh and Chidambaram are betting that a number of parties outside the ruling coalition don\u2019t want to go to elections now because they will lose seats and so won\u2019t bring the government down over the policy moves.\nMayawati\u2019s BSP was routed in regional elections in March in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state, and may not want to face voters again soon. Meantime, the BJP has yet to decide who will lead the party into the next election and what direction it should take.\n\u2018Fizzle Out\u2019\nThe role played by Chidambaram in winning party support for the policy changes has bolstered his standing and may make him a contender to succeed Singh in the top job, said B.G. Verghese, an analyst with the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi, who is a former aide to ex-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and has known Singh for 30 years.\n\u201cThe recent reforms have certainly given him a leg up and he will certainly be considered for the post because he is one of the brightest people in the party,\u201d said Verghese. The problem is \u201che has very firm views, there is an arrogance about him, and his political base is very narrow,\u201d he said.\nChidambaram said in the Oct. 12 interview that it was too early to discuss who will be the next prime minister when asked if he considers himself a candidate for the position.\n\u2018Take a Call\u2019\n\u201cWe will take a call on the leadership when we have to elect a leader,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the moment, I have a job at hand and let me do that job without being distracted.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s ability to persist with the policy overhaul hatched by Singh and Chidambaram in their bungalow meetings may determine whether Congress, the party that has dominated Indian politics since independence, remains the country\u2019s leading political force.\nThe government \u201cmay have acted too late to restore growth and their own credibility,\u201d said R.K. Gupta, the New Delhi- based managing director of Taurus Asset Management Ltd., which manages $672 million in assets. \u201cFor a sustained economic recovery the government needs to keep pushing ahead with reforms, they can\u2019t just let them fizzle out.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Unni Krishnan in New Delhi at ukrishnan2@bloomberg.net ; Andrew MacAskill in New Delhi at amacaskill@bloomberg.net ; Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Peter Hirschberg at phirschberg@bloomberg.net\nIndia's Manmohan Singh and Palaniappan Chidambaram\nRaveendran/AFP/Getty Images\nManmohan Singh, India's prime minister, right, and finance minister Palaniappan Chidambaram.\nManmohan Singh, India's prime minister, right, and finance minister Palaniappan Chidambaram.

(WMT) will sell and promote its new Web-connected device that brings live television and online video together, the companies said.\nStarting tomorrow, the world\u2019s biggest retailer will exclusively sell the new $98 product, called Boxee TV , in more than 3,000 U.S. locations during the holiday season. Wal-Mart will set up displays and send out marketing materials for the device, a small black box with a remote control that can access free TV broadcast channels as well as Internet content.\nBoxee and other set-top device makers including Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Roku Inc. are competing for consumers of Web-based entertainment, such as YouTube videos, Netflix Inc. (NFLX) \u2019s movies and Pandora Media Inc. (P) \u2019s online radio service. They are also trying to lure users seeking an alternative to cable and satellite TV services.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big launch for us,\u201d Avner Ronen, Boxee\u2019s chief executive officer, said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between having your product being carried by retailers, where it sits on the shelf, and getting real marketing behind it.\u201d\nHoliday shoppers are being presented with an array of new electronics products, from computers, tablets and phones to software and services from Apple, Microsoft Corp. and Google Inc. Boxee, a 5-year-old venture-backed company, has struggled to compete with Apple and closely held Roku.\nChannel Surfing\nLast year, Boxee sold 120,000 of its devices, which are manufactured by D-Link Corp. (2332) , while Roku sold 1.4 million, according to Jordan Selburn, an analyst for research firm IHS ISuppli. Apple said last week that the company sold 5.3 million Apple TV devices in the past 12 months. Roku\u2019s devices range in price from $50 to $100, while Apple TV sells for $99.\nConsumers haven\u2019t flocked to these devices because they don\u2019t have many of the shows offered on cable networks, Selburn said. That\u2019s not expected to change any time soon as broadcasters and pay-TV operators look to protect their lucrative businesses, he said.\n\u201cThe content owners are just far too reluctant to support streaming or downloaded access to their content,\u201d Selburn said.\nBoxee TV is a compelling option because it pulls in broadcast channels and Internet video into a single system, Ronen said. The device, which has a built-in antenna for accessing over-the-air TV signals, shows TV channels when it boots up, unlike services that typically ask users to navigate menus at the outset to decide what to watch.\n\u201cYou turn on the TV, and it\u2019s a familiar ground,\u201d Ronen said. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe the future of the TV is going to be a future filled with apps. When you turn on the TV, you don\u2019t want 60 icons. You just want to watch something.\u201d\nIncluded in Boxee TV is a service called No Limits DVR, which lets customers record unlimited broadcast TV shows to the cloud and access them from the set-top box or from a computer, smartphone or tablet. It will be available in about eight of the largest U.S. cities to start, Ronen said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Mark Milian in San Francisco at mmilian@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "MEXBOL", "embersId": "d8950d9221a02266d0cd6c8b58de4eed8eb77200"}, {"postTime": "2012-10-30 16:59:07", "postDate": "2012-10-30", "author": "Duane D.

Stanford, Cotten Timberlake and Renee Dudley - 2012-10-30T20:59:07Z\nRetailers from Walgreen Co. (WAG) to Macy\u2019s Inc. (M) kept stores shuttered in hard-hit New York and New Jersey while reopening some other East Coast locations as they worked to assess the damage to their shops and sales.\nWhile food merchants will benefit from consumers stocking up before the storm and home-improvement retailers will gain from the clean-up, clothing and department stores won\u2019t get a chance to make up the loss, Poonam Goyal, an analyst for Bloomberg Industries in Princeton, New Jersey, said today. The hit may even affect sales during the crucial holiday shopping season, she said.\n\u201cThe wild card here is when will stores reopen,\u201d Goyal said in a telephone interview today. \u201cIf stores will not reopen for the next two or three weeks, it\u2019s going to impact holiday sales.\u201d\nSandy, spanning 900 miles, slammed into southern New Jersey at about 8 p.m. New York time and brought a record storm surge of 13.88 feet (4.2 meters) into Manhattan\u2019s Battery Park. Flooding, high winds and fallen trees cut power to about 8 million customers from South Carolina to Maine, and travelers were stranded as U.S. airlines grounded about 12,500 flights. U.S. stock trading is closed again today in the first back-to- back shutdown for weather since 1888.\nRecord tides from the storm combined with hours of pounding wind and rain to flood electrical substations and shut down New York\u2019s financial district. Yesterday, Eqecat Inc., an Oakland, California-based provider of catastrophic risk models, estimated Sandy would cause as much as $20 billion of economic damage with about $5 billion to $10 billion of that in insured losses.\nWal-Mart Closings\nWal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) now has about 80 of its namesake and Sam\u2019s Club locations closed, according to the company\u2019s website.\nCompany officials have received no reports of significant damage to facilities, and merchandise losses were minimal, Mark Cooper, senior director of global emergency management for the retailer, said on a conference call. Stores will reopen as roads are cleared and power returns or generators are put into use, he said.\n\u201cTrucks are loaded and ready to go as soon as stores come open,\u201d he said.\nCostco Wholesale Corp. (COST) has about 15 stores still closed in New York and New Jersey because of power outages, Jeff Long, Costco\u2019s senior vice president for the Northeast, said in an interview. While stores in the Northeast sold out of water, generators, batteries and flashlights last weekend, traffic in open stores recently is less than the company normally expects, he said.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything like this,\u201d Long said. \u201cIt\u2019s easily the biggest storm I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\nTarget Closings\nTarget Corp. (TGT) has reopened most of its stores, with 20 locations in the New York and New Jersey areas still closed, Jessica Deede, a spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. About 41 stores are operating on generator power, she said.\nThe company\u2019s stores have begun donating basic items such as pillows and cribs to their local areas and has provided bottled water to the Red Cross, she said.\nHome Depot Inc. (HD) , the largest U.S. home-improvement retailer, began shipping 750 truckloads of generators, cleaning supplies, rakes and chainsaws to northeastern stores today, said Aaron Flowe, president of the Atlanta-based company\u2019s northern division. It has reopened all but about 12 of the 44 stores it closed as Sandy approached, he said.\nHome Depot stores suffered \u201cvery little damage\u201d characterized by leaking roofs and broken door glass \u201cthat we can quickly fix,\u201d Flowe said.\nLowe\u2019s Closings\nLowe\u2019s Cos. (LOW) , which had 200 locations in the affected area, has four stores closed, the company said today in an e-mailed statement. A store in Rosedale, New York, was damaged by water while the other closed stores, which are in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, are shut because of power outages.\nMacy\u2019s stores and offices in New York City and in central and northern New Jersey remain closed, said Jim Sluzewski , a spokesman. Stores in the Washington area and other parts of the East Coast have begun reopening today, he said.\n\u201cThe determining factor is if the store and shopping center have electricity, and if associates are able to get to work,\u201d Sluzewski said in an e-mail. The retailer had closed 130 Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s stores all day yesterday and closed an additional 65 stores early, he said.\nThe company has no reports of significant damage or injuries to workers, Sluzewski said. It is impossible to estimate lost sales at this point, he said.\nMacy\u2019s, based in Cincinnati, has more than 800 U.S. stores.\nSaks Manhattan\nSaks Inc. (SKS) \u2019s main store in Manhattan as well as stores in New Jersey, Connecticut and on New York\u2019s Long Island will reopen tomorrow, said Julia Bentley, a spokeswoman. The retailer, whose head offices in New York still are closed, will begin assessing damage today, she said. The company planned to reopen stores in the Washington area and in Pennsylvania starting late this morning.\nMacy\u2019s and Saks are among the retailers most likely to be hurt by Sandy, data compiled by Bloomberg Industries show. Macy\u2019s has about 30 percent of its stores located in the storm states, and Saks has about 27 percent of its locations there. The retailers reported a 150 basis-point hit to August comparable-store sales last year because of Hurricane Irene.\nNordstrom Inc. (JWN) , the Seattle-based chain of more than 100 department stores, had 15 stores still closed today with many others opening late, partly because mass transit disruptions prevented some employees from getting to work, said Tara Darrow, a spokeswoman. Stores had minor water damage, and the company hasn\u2019t yet estimated the effect on sales, she said.\nSpending Needs\nPeople are now spending on needs, which may alter their shopping plans for the rest of the year and reduce the 4.1 percent growth the National Retail Federation forecast for the holiday season, Scott Bernhardt, president of Planalytics Inc. in Wayne, Pennsylvania, said today in an e-mail.\n\u201cSignificant spending now, this week is likely going to cause many consumers to revisit their holiday shopping budgets,\u201d he said.\nGap Inc. (GPS) continues to monitor its stores in the Northeast that were closed due to the hurricane, Edie Kissko, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based company, said yesterday in an e-mail.\n\u201cGap Inc. has been taking several precautions, including implementing an emergency protocol to help ensure all employees are accounted for and safe during this natural disaster,\u201d she wrote yesterday.\nAmerican Eagle\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO) , which closed 64 stores yesterday, is reopening some locations as power is restored, \u201cbut our employees\u2019 safety and well-being is our number one concern at this point and so we are focused on making sure everyone is accounted for and safe,\u201d Iris Yen, a spokeswoman for the Pittsburgh-based company, said in an e-mail.\nLimited Brands Inc., which owns the Victoria\u2019s Secret and Bath & Body Works chains, reopened some of its stores today at 1 p.m., Tammy Roberts Myers, a spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The Columbus, Ohio-based company closed about 160 stores yesterday.\nApparel companies will face most of Hurricane Sandy\u2019s impact in November sales because October results will only go up until Oct. 27, Jennifer Davis , an analyst with Lazard Capital Markets in New York, said in a telephone interview. The hit also won\u2019t be significant because the storm struck on a Monday and Tuesday, which aren\u2019t busy shopping days, she said.\n\u201cThe very beginning of November is not really important and the very end of the month is, so it\u2019s during a small volume period during small volume days,\u201d she said.\nThe bigger concern is how long stores will be closed, especially those that were damaged, she said.\nJ.C. Penney\nJ.C. Penney Co. (JCP) , the 110-year-old department-store company, closed more than 100 stores by yesterday evening because of the storm, Joey Thomas, a spokesman for the Plano, Texas-based retailer, said in an e-mail. The company plans to reopen 50 stores in the next couple of days and is assessing damage.\nWalgreen, which owns the Duane Reade chain, had about 530 stores closed as of noon, down from a peak of about 750, the company said today in an e-mailed statement. The company has about 1,400 stores in the affected area.\nBeginning last week, Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreen stocked shelves with extra water, batteries, flashlights and medications, the company said yesterday.\nWalgreen Shutdowns\nWalgreen, the largest drugstore chain in the U.S., also said it has 180 electricity generators to help power stores along the East Coast and dry ice to keep certain medicines cold. About 300 stores were without power, the company said.\nThe storm may benefit mass merchants\u2019 October sales as shoppers stocked up on water and food before it hit, according to Bloomberg Industries. The effect on November sales will be determined by how long stores are closed and how much of Halloween sales were missed, according to the study.\nA few Kroger Co. (KR) stores along the East Coast have closed after losing power, Carl York, the company\u2019s head of public affairs for its Mid-Atlantic region, said in an interview. Right now, the company is working to open a store in Elkins, West Virginia, which closed after it lost power amid about a foot of snow, York said.\nWest Virginia\n\u201cWe\u2019re concentrating on West Virginia now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of rain and a lot of snow and we\u2019re worried about flooding.\u201d\nNo damage has been reported at Kroger\u2019s 122 stores in the Mid-Atlantic region, he said. Kroger, the largest U.S. grocery- store chain, is based in Cincinnati.\n\u201cWe are still very busy,\u201d York said. \u201cWe have customers that are coming in and they are buying the milk, bread, water. They\u2019re still bracing for the weather hanging around.\u201d\nSupervalu Inc. (SVU) has started opening stores after closing all Acme and Shoppers locations yesterday, Mike Siemienas , a spokesman for the Eden Prairie , Minnesota-based company, said in an interview. The third-largest U.S. grocery chain still has 29 Acme and about 30 Save-A-Lot stores closed, while all Shaw\u2019s, Farm Fresh and Shoppers units are open, he said.\nThere are Acme stores that don\u2019t have power that are open and operating on generators, Siemienas said. The company is unable to get to some shuttered Acme markets along the Jersey Shore to evaluate possible damage, he said.\nPepsiCo Inc.\u2019s (PEP) headquarters in Purchase, New York, and some other offices in the area remained closed today. Several of the snack and beverage maker\u2019s factories, warehouses and offices in Sandy\u2019s path were without power and teams were assessing damages, said Aurora Gonzalez, a company spokeswoman.\n\u201cOur first priority is the safety of our employees,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cWe are working to resume operations as quickly and as safely as possible.\u201d\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Duane D.

It temporarily stopped the U.S. presidential race eight days before Election Day and led President Barack Obama to declare New York and New Jersey as disaster regions eligible for federal relief. Government offices and U.S. stock markets were shut for a second day amid damage that may total billions of dollars.\n\u201cNow she\u2019s overland, she\u2019s lost her power source and is diminishing in strength,\u201d Dan Williams, an Exeter, U.K.-based spokesman for the Met Office , said today by phone. \u201cThe pressure in the center is not as low as before. She\u2019s forecast to make a turn to the north and by Friday will still be over parts of Canada on its current track.\u201d\nSandy, now termed a post-tropical cyclone packing maximum sustained winds of 65 miles (105 kilometers) per hour, down from 75 mph earlier, was centered about 90 miles west of Philadelphia at 5 a.m. local time, according to the Maryland-based Hydrometeorological Prediction Center . The storm was moving west-northwest at 15 mph, and was expected to weaken steadily over the next two days and move north into western New York state later today. The cyclone will reach Canada tomorrow.\nNYC Blackout\nAt least 3.6 million homes and businesses without power yesterday, the U.S. Energy Department said. Shuttered oil refineries boosted gasoline futures prices\nPower was lost in Manhattan \u201criver to river,\u201d south of 35th Street, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a press briefing. Some of the blackout was deliberate, as Consolidated Edison Co. (ED) shut off electricity to protect its underground equipment from potential damage, said Chris Olert, a spokesman for the company.\nA flood gauge in New York City\u2019s Battery Park, at the southernmost end of Manhattan, registered 13.46 feet as of 8:30 p.m. The National Weather Service said the modern record was 10.02 feet in September 1960 during Hurricane Donna.\nQueens Fire\nA fire in Breezy Point in the New York City borough of Queens has about 198 firefighters working to contain a blaze that has already destroyed at least 50 homes and left two people with minor injuries, a New York Fire Department official said today. The department also posted details on the fire on the social media site Twitter. Separately, a man was killed in the borough by a falling tree, emergency officials said.\nSixteen deaths were reported in New Jersey , New York, Maryland , North Carolina, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Connecticut , according to the Associated Press . Some of the victims were killed by falling trees; at least one death was attributed to the storm in Canada. The storm was blamed for 69 deaths in the Caribbean, the AP said.\nSandy may cause as much as $20 billion in economic damage and losses, according to Eqecat Inc., a risk-management company in Oakland, California.\nInsured losses may exceed $6 billion in the U.S., led by costs in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and New York, according to estimates from Kinetic Analysis Corp. compiled by Bloomberg. As many as 10 million people may lose power, according to Seth Guikema, a Johns Hopkins University engineer.\nFlights Canceled\nCounting yesterday\u2019s disruptions, airlines are flying about 12,500 fewer trips than they had planned in the 48 hours ending today, according to FlightAware, a Houston-based tracking company, and mass transit stopped in New York, parts of New Jersey, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington.\nAll U.S. equity markets, which were closed yesterday, will be shut again today, the first shutdown for consecutive days due to weather since 1888. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association said bond trading would be suspended today.\nCrude oil fell to a three-month low yesterday while gasoline prices rose as East Coast refineries curbed operations. Both futures contracts advanced in electronic trading today.\nPhillips 66 (PSX) , NuStar Energy LP (NS) and Hess Corp. (HES) shut or reduced output at three New Jersey refineries ahead of the storm\u2019s landfall. At least three other plants were running at reduced rates.\nHolland Tunnel\nIn New York, Mayor Bloomberg , the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, issued evacuation orders for 375,000 people and opened 76 shelters. The Lincoln Tunnel to New Jersey was the only major crossing in and out of Manhattan by about 8:30 p.m. yesterday. The Brooklyn-Battery and Holland tunnels shut because of flood risks, and high winds closed the George Washington and Verrazano bridges.\nOn 57th Street, a crane on a 90-story residential building under construction partially collapsed and was dangling over the street. No injuries were reported.\nWith Lower Manhattan almost a ghost town for a second day, seawater cascaded into the still-gaping construction pit at the World Trade Center, the AP reported today.\nOff North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks, one person was killed and another was missing after the crew of the HMS Bounty , a replica of the vessel that was the scene of a 1789 mutiny, abandoned ship when it capsized in 18-foot seas.\nAtlantic City\nIn New Jersey, Governor Chris Christie ordered evacuations of coastal barrier islands and casinos in Atlantic City, which was flooded. A large number of people were stranded as water levels rose. Christie said further evacuations from Atlantic City and the barrier island would be impossible until daylight.\n\u201cFor those of you who are on the barrier islands who decided it was better idea to wait this out than to evacuate, and for those elected officials who decided to ignore my admonition, this is now your responsibility,\u201d Christie said at a 5:35 p.m. news briefing. \u201cEvacuations are no longer possible.\u201d\nA 21-member search-and-rescue team will be sent to Atlantic City starting at daybreak today. Another team with 40 members and 10 boats, based in Lakehurst, will be dispatched to other barrier islands. About 130 miles of the 172-mile Garden State Parkway were closed.\nIn Connecticut, Governor Dannel Malloy appealed to residents near the coast and low-lying areas to get to higher ground. \u201cThousands of people are stranded,\u201d he said at a news briefing.\nIn New London, on Long Island Sound, Mayor Daryl Finizio told WFSB television that Sandy was worse than the Great New England Hurricane of 1938. That storm, which produced tides of as much as 25 feet, killed 564, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .\nThe storm is also affecting the Nov. 6 elections.

Gary Shilling\n2012-10-29T22:30:52Z\nFederal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke calculates that the benefits of a third round of quantitative easing will outweigh the negatives.\nBy buying mortgage-related securities, the Fed aims to further drive down house-loan rates to encourage refinancing and induce home buying. Yet mortgage rates have already declined tremendously with no obvious impact on housing activity, and homebuyers certainly didn\u2019t show the enthusiasm for the first two rounds of quantitative easing that equity investors did.\nSome observers believe the Fed wants to use inflation and negative real rates to reduce the burden of the Treasury\u2019s huge debt by paying bond holders negative real returns. I am skeptical that the Fed has any sinister motivation. This notion of a policy of \u201cfinancial repression\u201d belongs in the same category as the mistaken belief that the Fed is hyping its balance sheet and bank reserves to generate serious inflation as a way to reduce the real value of federal debt, also at the expense of government-security owners. Such strategies are the hallmark of the likes of Zimbabwe or banana republics.\nYet the absence of sinister motivations doesn\u2019t mean the Fed\u2019s actions haven\u2019t had distorting effects on the economy. Interest rates close to zero create deviations from the norm and produce a new set of relationships that few forecasters and policy makers fully understand. This low- or no-interest-rate world also has winners and losers.\nNegative Rates\nLet\u2019s look at the beneficiaries. At a zero federal funds rate , the Fed can\u2019t cut any further in reaction to economic weakness. If deflation occurs, the central bank can\u2019t push real rates negative to stimulate borrowing. Furthermore, the lack of response to almost-zero interest rates by lenders and borrowers is what compelled the Fed, and earlier the Bank of Japan , into the new world of quantitative easing. This and other non- interest rate actions taken previously also have pushed the Fed uncomfortably close to fiscal policy and threatened its independence.\nWhile I doubt that the Fed in any way intended to ease the federal debt and deficit , it is important to keep in mind that low interest rates keep the cost of financing the debt low, even as the amount of borrowing leaps. I wouldn\u2019t suggest, of course, that these low financing costs encourage Congress and the administration to delay dealing with the mushrooming federal debt.\nStill, after deducting its own operating expenses, the Fed returns the interest it receives on the holding of Treasuries and agency securities to the Treasury, helping to offset the deficit. In a recent speech, Bernanke said that in the past three years the Fed has remitted $200 billion to the Treasury. Central banking is a neat game. The Fed creates money out of thin air, uses it to buy securities and then sends the interest, after expenses, back to the government. How do the rest of us get in on it?\nCentral-bank rates close to zero also promoted the strange phenomenon of negative returns on short-term government securities . Then there is the recent negative 0.75 percent yield on 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, whose returns are adjusted for inflation. If annual consumer-price increases over the next decade turn out to be 2.5 percent, as forecast by the spread between 10-year TIPS and 10-year Treasury notes, the return on the TIPS would be slightly less than 2.5 percent annually.\nThe federal government, of course, isn\u2019t the only borrower benefiting from low interest costs and negative real rates. Residential mortgagors , if they can qualify for loans, obviously are getting a break with 30-year rates at 3.4 percent.\nCorporate Debt\nInvestment-grade corporations have been able to issue debt and refinance at low rates, and many are doing so. In July, $75 billion was issued, a record for any July, at 3.2 percent average yields, a record low, and particularly noteworthy compared with an average 7.2 percent yield over the last 30 days. In the third quarter, $257 billion was issued, 64 percent more than a year earlier. To be sure, low corporate-bond yields are partly due to individual investors\u2019 disdain for stocks; and investment-grade corporates also have appeal as havens.\nLow interest costs as well as tax deductibility make it attractive to issue bonds instead of equity. Some entities are issuing century bonds. Last year, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Norfolk Southern Corp., Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Procter & Gamble Co . and Coca-Cola Co. all locked up borrowing that doesn\u2019t mature for 100 years.\nIn August 2011, the University of Southern California issued $300 million in century bonds with a 5.25 percent coupon yield, compared with a 3.4 percent yield at the time on 30-year Treasuries. The relatively small premium for an additional 70 years suggests that buyers of that issue don\u2019t see a danger of inflation for many years.\nAnother winner from low interest rates, and especially QE3, are agency securities. On Sept. 13, when QE3 was announced, Fannie Mae (FNMA) mortgage-backed securities with a 3 percent interest- rate coupon jumped 1-10/32 points, outperforming the 10-year Treasury note by 1-4/36 points. Normally, the performance difference in a trading day is less than 5/32 point. The Fed\u2019s $40 billion-a-month purchase of agency debt via QE3 is the equivalent of a major part of the normal $140 billion monthly issuance.\nDividend-paying stocks have also benefited from low interest rates, despite average yields of only 2.1 percent for Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index (SPXL1) stocks. Furthermore, the equities collapse in 2008 and the S&P 500\u2019s zero net gain from 1998 through 2011 and no gain in 2011 have steered many institutional and individual investors to bonds and to stocks that pay high, sustainable and increasing dividends. These investors want income here and now as opposed to pie-in-the-sky capital appreciation sometime in the future.\nDividend Payouts\nInvestors are putting increasing pressure on corporate managements to pay dividends, and in August, S&P 500 companies paid out a record $34 billion. This pressure is also reflected in stock repurchases. Although they aren\u2019t always completed, the timing of actual purchases is uncertain and repurchases sometimes simply offset new issuances to employees, S&P 500 companies (SPX) have announced $429 billion in equity buybacks for 2012. That\u2019s down, however, from $555 billion last year.\nCompanies such as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. that are no longer perceived as growth stocks are under heavy pressure to pay dividends. Wal-Mart\u2019s (WMT) dividends have risen 5.3 times in the past decade and the dividend yield is now an average 2.1 percent, even as the stock price has risen only about 50 percent in that time.\nInterestingly, the total return on dividend-paying stocks beat nonpayers in every year since 2000, except 2003 and 2009. If $10,000 had been invested in nondividend-paying stocks in 1979, it would have been worth $250,000 in 2010, but the same amount invested in dividend-payers would have risen to $413,000. Part of this superior result, of course, is the compounding of reinvested dividends.\nInterest rates close to zero have also made highly leveraged speculation in commodities very cheap. Still, commodity prices have been declining on balance since early 2011, suggesting that low-cost financing, droughts and other positive factors have been more than offset by the global recession and hard landing in China .\nI have always been agnostic on gold. Its price is influenced by so many forces that it is hard to figure out how they play out on balance, and often they cancel each other out. Think about political risk, economic uncertainty, inflation and deflation, central-bank holdings, Indians who buy gold in good times and trade down to silver in bad, new gold-mining techniques, the gold bugs who hold a gold bar in one hand and an AK-47 and dried food in the other.\nIn the inflationary 1970s, gold leaped to more than $800 per ounce as it was sought as an inflation hedge. Then its price fell for two decades. The current jump seems to be a haven play and also reflects distrust for paper currencies in general. There has been little inflation lately, and the dollar has been trending up, so those factors aren\u2019t responsible. Gold is also probably being propelled by low interest rates, which reduce its carrying costs, and the uncertain atmosphere that surrounds zero or even negative rates. Still, gold returns nothing, and even at zero interest rates, costs money to keep secure and to store.\nTomorrow, I will describe the negative effects of low interest rates.\n(A.

Deprez, Henry Goldman and Tori Stilwell - 2012-10-29T21:12:02Z\nHurricane Sandy \u2019s impending arrival in the most populous U.S. city has ended at least one perennial New York frustration -- getting a taxi in the rain.\nOver an hour and a half this morning, Nassir Pandhair, who\u2019s been driving a cab for 25 years, picked up just three customers and earned about $25, half what he\u2019d normally earn in the period.\n\u201cIt feels like a quiet Sunday morning,\u201d Pandhair, 54 of Valley Stream, New York, said as he cruised up Third Avenue on Manhattan \u2019s Upper East Side alongside a half-dozen yellow taxis whose backseats were empty as his.\nResidents bracing for the largest Atlantic storm ever recorded woke up to a more muted version of the city that never sleeps as public schools, the New York Stock Exchange and even Saks Inc. (SKS) \u2019s Saks Fifth Avenue and Macy\u2019s Inc. (M) \u2019s Bloomingdale\u2019s flagship outlets were shuttered.\nThe normally 24-hour-a-day mass transit system closed due to weather for just the second time in its 108-year history. Pedestrians were sparse and the usual Manhattan traffic jams nonexistent as thousands of evacuees camped out in shelters after evacuating low-lying areas where water had begun collecting. Winds caused the partial collapse of a crane attached to a luxury tower on West 57th Street in Manhattan.\nBesting Irene\nThe major risk to the city\u2019s 8 million people in five boroughs will come at high tide after 8 p.m. local time, when a storm surge is predicted to near a record 12 feet (3.7 meters), enough to flood streets, basements and, potentially, subways and car tunnels, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a press briefing at the Office of Emergency Management in Brooklyn .\nA 3-meter storm surge at the Battery in Manhattan might cause between $5.65 billion and $11.55 billion in damage, according to Ning Lin, professor of civil and environmental Engineering at Princeton University in New Jersey . She said any wind and rain damage aren\u2019t included in the estimate.\nEven before the tidal surge, New Yorkers were seeing flooding comparable to the worst of Hurricane Irene last year, with water covering the esplanade at Battery Park City along the Hudson River and the FDR Drive on Manhattan\u2019s East Side, Bloomberg said.\n\u201cThe greatest danger posed by Sandy is the coastal storm surge it will produce,\u201d said Bloomberg, founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP. \u201cIt may be a good time to just stay hunkered into your home and have a sandwich out of the fridge and sit back and watch television.\u201d\nPowerless Breakfast\nAt the Loews (L) Regency Hotel on Park Avenue, where Wall Streeters, politicians and media moguls greet the day over eggs and coffee, \u201cit wasn\u2019t much of a power breakfast today,\u201d said Leigh Wynn, restaurant manager. By 10 a.m., the dining room\u2019s skeleton work crew had served 30 customers, mostly hotel guests, compared with its typical 170, she said.\nAs Manhattanites disappeared from the streets, residents and businesspeople in Coney Island prepared for the worst as police cleared the boardwalk and beach. Half of the area could be under water after the tide comes in, said Domenic Recchia, a New York City council member who\u2019d been surveying the storm from the boardwalk.\nFrank Sciortino, co-owner of Knapp Street Pizza in Coney Island, said his gas-powered ovens will keep cranking out pies until 11 p.m. Sciortino said he didn\u2019t take precautions against the storm, calling his preparation for Irene a \u201dwaste of time.\u201d\nStorm Skeptic\n\u201cPeople have to eat,\u201d said Sciortino, 29, whose family has owned the space since 1994. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that bad of a storm. I don\u2019t trust the weatherman. If it comes, it comes.\u201d\nBack in Manhattan, the storm began to cut residents off from much of the outside world\nExpected flooding prompted New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to order the closing of the Tappan Zee Bridge north of New York City as well as crossings in the city, including the Holland Tunnel and George Washington and Verrazano-Narrows bridges to New Jersey, the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel to Brooklyn -- also known as the Brooklyn-Battery -- and the Throgs Neck, Bronx-Whitestone and Henry Hudson spans.\nCuomo also doubled, to more than 2,000, the number of National Guard troops to help deal with a storm surge already about 9.5 feet high, the peak water levels seen when Irene struck in August 2011, he said.\nLights Out\nAs of 4 p.m., about 45,000 people were without power throughout the city\u2019s five boroughs. About 6,500 in lower Manhattan below Wall Street will likely lose power this evening to protect the system, said Alfonso Quiroz, a spokesman for Consolidated Edison Inc. (ED) , which supplies New York City and parts of Westchester County with electric power.\nBusiness at Ray Bari Pizza in midtown Manhattan was bustling. Alejandro Vazquez, 27, had already delivered, on bike and foot, 20 pizzas by lunchtime to hungry urbanites holed up in their apartments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very busy today,\u201d Vazquez said while zipping up his windbreaker. \u201cNobody wants to go outside so everybody stays at home and orders pizza and pasta.\u201d\nIt\u2019s too early to estimate how much the storm will cost the city in worker overtime, said Chris Miller, press secretary for the municipality\u2019s Office of Emergency Management.\nWhile Bloomberg must close a $635 million midyear deficit in his $68.5 billion budget, created when a judge barred the city from selling 2,000 taxi medallions, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will soften the financial impact of repairing damaged infrastructure and personal property, U.S. Senator Charles Schumer said.\nKeeping Watch\nRepairs were not the immediate concern of Ricky Coronado, however, as he sat on the steps of his mother\u2019s house in the Rockaways, a Queens beachfront neighborhood.\nAs water lapped at the tops of fire hydrants a few blocks away, Coronado, 32, said he was concerned about people seeking shelter breaking into abandoned houses.\n\u201cIt\u2019s worse than last year,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave the house alone.\u201d\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Esme E.

(HD)\nSandy may cut November same-store sales by as much as 3 percent, according to Oliver Chen, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in New York. Traffic may fall 40 percent in affected areas in November\u2019s first week, which accounts for about 22 percent of the month\u2019s sales, Chen said in a note.\nRetailers shut locations along the East Coast today as Sandy barreled into the region. The storm may help discount and home-improvement stores as consumers stock up on supplies, while reducing purchases at specialty-apparel chains, he said. American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO) , Limited Brands Inc. (LTD) and Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN) are among the companies with the highest percentages of their stores affected by the storm, Chen said.\n\u201cWe expect Hurricane Sandy\u2019s impact on the East Coast to be mixed,\u201d Deborah Weinswig , a Citigroup analyst, said in an e- mail. \u201cThe storm will disrupt last-minute Halloween sales and mall traffic but drive stock-up trips to the discounters.\u201d\nRetail is just one industry hit by the storm as restaurants, schools, office buildings and equity markets shut for the day and travel is restricted. Economic damages from the hurricane may total as much as $20 billion, including as much as $10 billion in insured losses, according to estimates from Eqecat Inc., a provider of catastrophe risk models.\nEconomic Effect\nSandy could shave 0.1 percentage point to 0.2 percentage point from the annualized rate of U.S. economic growth in the fourth quarter, said Mark Vitner , a senior economist at Wells Fargo & Co. in Charlotte, North Carolina. The economy expanded at a 2 percent pace in the third quarter.\nWhile some retailers may see a boost in sales after the hurricane, \u201cthere\u2019s a loss of activity that\u2019s going to be hard to make up,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a restaurant and you\u2019re closed today, people are not going to eat two lunches tomorrow.\u201d\nHome Depot has a command center of 300 to 350 employees in four rooms at its home office in Atlanta working to prepare stores and associates for the hurricane, Doug Spiron, the company\u2019s storm captain and merchandising manager for its southern division, said yesterday.\n\u201cThis one has got so may facets to it -- you\u2019ve got wind, you\u2019ve got rain, you\u2019ve got snow, you\u2019ve got the full moon, you\u2019ve got the storm surge and yesterday we had a tsunami warning, for goodness sake,\u201d Spiron said today by telephone. \u201cThen there\u2019s the impact of the sheer size of the storm. This one takes it to another whole level of preparation.\u201d\nHome Depot\nHome Depot and Lowe\u2019s Cos. (LOW) , the largest U.S. home- improvement retailers, have trucked hundreds of loads of generators, flashlights, plywood and chainsaws to stores in Hurricane Sandy\u2019s path, according to Spiron and Terry Johnson, Lowe\u2019s senior vice president for its North region.\nHome Depot has closed 18 stores in areas where local governments have mandated closings, Spiron said. Lowe\u2019s, based in Mooresville, North Carolina , said in an e-mailed statement it plans 73 closings.\nWal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world\u2019s biggest retailer, has identified about 900 stores and clubs that are in the projected path of the storm, Dianna Gee, a spokeswoman for the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company, said today in a phone interview. The company has closed 88 stores, according to its website.\nPossible Shortages\nSome locations may have temporary shortages of water and other key items, Gee said. Immediately replenishing supplies may become impossible if trucks are forced to stay put due to high winds or road closings, she said.\nIn stores along evacuation routes, Wal-Wart has filled shelves with can-openers, ready-to-eat packaged foods and air mattresses for people forced from their homes, Gee said.\nThe company\u2019s staff meteorologists are keeping tabs on potential long-term impact to stores along the East Coast. Wal- Mart has back-up generators ready in areas that may need emergency power.\n\u201cAs the storm intensifies, we anticipate more store closings,\u201d Gee said. \u201cWe hope that they are temporary.\u201d\nHurricane Sandy is predicted to make landfall late today in southern New Jersey, then turn inland, according to an advisory from the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Winds may cause a tidal surge as high as a record 11 feet (3 meters), according to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg .\nSustained Winds\nSandy packed maximum sustained winds of 85 miles (140 kilometers) per hour, up from 75 mph earlier, the center said at 5 a.m. New York time. The storm\u2019s eye was about 285 miles east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and about 385 miles south- southeast of New York, moving north at 15 mph. It is not expected to weaken before landfall, the center said.\nTarget Corp. (TGT) closed 14 stores in New York, New Jersey and Delaware, Jessica Deede, a Target spokeswoman, said in an e- mail. An additional 16 stores in Virginia will close this afternoon, Deede said.\nSupervalu Inc. (SVU) has closed 11 of its Acme stores in New Jersey and one in Maryland, Mike Siemienas , a company spokesman, said in an interview. The company also has closed some Save-A- Lot stores in New Jersey, he said.\n\u201cOur goal is to open our stores as quickly as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that customers will need products.\u201d\nGrocery Closings\nOther Supervalu chains that may be affected include Farm Fresh, Shoppers and Shaw\u2019s, he said.\nKroger Co. (KR) , the largest U.S. grocery-store chain, has been stocking its mid-Atlantic locations with extra bread, milk, and bottled water, Keith Dailey, a spokesman for the Cincinnati- based company, said in an interview. The stores also are increasing inventories of batteries, flashlights and ice, he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been preparing for well over a week,\u201d he said. Some locations in Virginia Beach, Virginia, are selling plywood, sandbags and consumer generators, he said.\nKroger stores and warehouses in the Midwest are getting ready for high winds and possible power outages with generators and refrigerated trucks, he said. There were no Kroger stores closed as of this morning, Dailey said.\nCabin Fever\nDeborah Chusid, a 50-year-old art director who lives in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, was out at the Petco pet-supply store this morning to pick up some dog food and delay the onset of cabin fever.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s going to get worse,\u201d she said.\nChusid took care of her emergency grocery shopping yesterday and will be temporarily housing her son, a freshman at the City University of New York\u2019s Macaulay Honors College who was evacuated from his dorm near the East River.\nAbout 130 Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s stores will be closed today, as well as the Macy\u2019s unit\u2019s New York offices, said Jim Sluzewski , a spokesman. Cincinnati-based Macy\u2019s Inc. (M) has more than 800 stores in the U.S.\nSaks Inc. (SKS) , the New York-based luxury chain, closed 10 stores from the Washington area to Boston, including the Manhattan flagship, which it boarded up at 4 p.m. yesterday, said Julia Bentley, a spokeswoman.\nMacy\u2019s has about 30 percent of its stores exposed to the hurricane, and Saks has about 27 percent, according to Bloomberg Industries. The two retailers reported a 150 basis-point loss to August sales last year because of Hurricane Irene, according to Bloomberg Industries.\nBest Buy Co. closed about 179 stores along the East Coast, Amy von Walter, a spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.\nLimited Brands\nLimited Brands, which owns the Victoria\u2019s Secret and Bath & Body Works chains, has about 160 stores closed today, Tammy Roberts Myers, a spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The Columbus, Ohio-based company is watching the impact of the storm to determine future plans, she wrote. Limited Brands had 2,883 stores as of Sept. 29.\nAmerican Eagle has 64 stores closed today and shut its Manhattan locations at 5 p.m. yesterday for the safety of employees, Iris Yen, a spokeswoman for the Pittsburgh-based company said in an e-mail. American Eagle had 1,063 locations as of July 28.\nStarbucks will have almost 1,000 stores closed along the East Coast from Virginia to Maine as of 4 p.m., Haley Drage, a spokeswoman for Seattle-based Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , said in an interview.\nDunkin\u2019 Closings\nDunkin\u2019 Brands Group Inc. (DNKN) , owner of the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts coffee-shop brand, has closed about 100 stores in the Northeast, Michelle King, a spokeswoman for the Canton, Massachusetts-based company, said in an e-mail.\nPepsiCo Inc. (PEP) , the world\u2019s largest snack-food maker, told the 1,300 employees at its headquarters in Purchase, New York, to stay home today and took its delivery trucks off the road ahead of Sandy\u2019s arrival, Aurora Gonzalez, a spokeswoman, said in an interview.\nThe company\u2019s distribution centers and plants in the area ran overtime on the weekend to meet increased demand as stores stocked up on Pepsi, Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats products, she said.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Sapna Maheshwari in New York at sapnam@bloomberg.net ; Renee Dudley in New York at rdudley6@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Robin Ajello at rajello@bloomberg.net\nHurricane Sandy Threatens November Retail Sales as Stores Close\nMike Stobe/Getty Images\nPeople stock up on supplies at a hardware store as Hurricane Sandy approaches in Long Beach, New York.\nPeople stock up on supplies at a hardware store as Hurricane Sandy approaches in Long Beach, New York.

The storm, 900 miles wide, prompted warnings of life-threatening surges from Virginia to Massachusetts, emptied the streets of the nation\u2019s largest cities, paralyzed mass-transit systems and lashed the East Coast with gales, rain and even snow. It shut the federal government and state administrations, and prevented U.S. stock markets from opening for two days.

(WMT) asked a federal judge to deny a bid by 11 women to pursue gender-discrimination claims on behalf of female employees who worked for the retailer in Florida , North Carolina , Virginia and four other southeastern U.S. states.\nCiting a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that shattered a planned national group lawsuit known as Dukes v. Wal-Mart, the company on Oct. 26 asked Fort Lauderdale, Florida, U.S. District Judge Robert N. Scola Jr. to reject the women\u2019s bid to create a smaller, regional suit and asked him to limit participation in the case to those who brought it.\nFiled on Oct. 4, the Fort Lauderdale lawsuit is one of four regional cases being pressed by women who worked for the world\u2019s biggest retailer and allegedly suffered pay and promotion discrimination.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court held that the Dukes plaintiffs could not proceed on behalf of a nationwide class, not because of its size, but because plaintiffs had failed to \u2018establish the existence of any common question,\u2019\u201d the Bentonville, Arkansas- based company told Scola in its filing.\nWal-Mart currently employs more than 94,000 people in Florida alone, the company said, citing the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.\nBid Dismissed\nWhile Wal-Mart contends the class action rejected by the Supreme Court cannot be revived, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney Joseph Sellers said in a phone interview today that other high court precedent supports his position.\nMembers of a failed class don\u2019t lose the right to sue as a group simply because the time to do so lapsed while legal challenges were pending, he said.\n\u201cOur clients ultimately want a chance to try their claims,\u201d Sellers said. \u201cIf they win, they win. If they lose, they lose.\u201d\nU.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor in Dallas on Oct. 15 dismissed a bid by women from Texas and neighboring states to sue the company as a group, ruling the class claims were filed too late.\nThe original Dukes case is still pending in San Francisco , where a federal judge last month said a group could be certified if it meets criteria outlined by the Supreme Court. Another case has been filed in Tennessee.\nThe case is Love v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., 12-cv-61959, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale).\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Andrew Harris in Chicago at aharris16@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Hytha at mhytha@bloomberg.net\nMore News:\n", "source": "Bloomberg News", "stockIndex": "MEXBOL", "embersId": "858fdcfd5d4152adbf00929b7271f2e8c8d427de"}]}
